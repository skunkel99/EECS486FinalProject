            "text": "Background: More than half of the global population is under strict forms of social distancing. Estimating the expected impact of lockdown and exit strategies is critical to inform decision makers on the management of the COVID-19 health crisis. Methods: We use a stochastic age-structured transmission model integrating data on age profile and social contacts in \u00cele-de-France to (i) assess the epidemic in the region, (ii) evaluate the impact of lockdown, and (iii) propose possible exit strategies and estimate their effectiveness. The model is calibrated to hospital admission data before lockdown. Interventions are modeled by reconstructing the associated changes in the contact matrices and informed by mobility reductions during lockdown evaluated from mobile phone data. Different types and durations of social distancing are simulated, including progressive and targeted strategies, with large-scale testing. Results: We estimate the reproductive number at 3.18 [3.09, 3.24] (95% confidence interval) prior to lockdown and at 0.68 [0.66, 0.69] during lockdown, thanks to an 81% reduction of the average number of contacts. Model predictions capture the disease dynamics during lockdown, showing the epidemic curve reaching ICU system capacity, largely strengthened during the emergency, and slowly decreasing. Results suggest that physical contacts outside households were largely avoided during lockdown. Lifting the lockdown with no exit strategy would lead to a second wave overwhelming the healthcare system, if conditions return to normal. Extensive case finding and isolation are required for social distancing strategies to gradually relax lockdown constraints. Conclusions: As France experiences the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic in lockdown, intensive forms of social distancing are required in the upcoming months due to the currently low population immunity. Extensive case finding and isolation would allow the partial release of the socio-economic pressure caused by extreme measures, while avoiding healthcare demand exceeding capacity. Response planning needs to urgently prioritize the logistics and capacity for these interventions.",

The infectious phase is divided into two steps: a prodromic phase (I p ) occurring before the end of the incubation period, followed by a phase where individuals may remain either asymptomatic (I a ) or develop symptoms. In the latter case, we distinguish between different degrees of severity of symptoms, ranging from paucisymptomatic (I ps ), to infectious individuals with mild (I ms ) or severe (I ss ) symptoms, according to data from Italian COVID-19 epidemic [18] and estimates from individual-case data from China and other countries [19] . We explore two values of the probability of being asymptomatic, namely p a = 20% and 50%, in line with available estimates [20] [21] [22] . Individuals in the prodromic phase and asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals have a smaller transmission rate with respect to individuals with moderate or severe symptoms, as reported by contact tracing investigations [23] and estimated in Ref. [8] . Current evidence from household studies, contact tracing investigations, and modeling works suggest that children are as likely to be infected by COVID-19 as adults, but more likely to become either asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic [22, [24] [25] [26] . This may explain the very small percentage (< 5%) of children in COVID-19 confirmed cases worldwide [27] . Here we assume that children in both classes (younger children and adolescents) are equally susceptible as adults, following Ref. [24] , and that they become either asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic only. Different relative susceptibility or infectivity of children compared to adults is tested for sensitivity analysis.",

We consider that 5% of adults may stay at home to take care of children while schools are closed (not applied with telework or lockdown). Telework performed by a given % of individuals: contacts at work and on transports are reduced to account for the % of workers not going to work anymore. In France, telework is performed daily by 6% of the active adult population [37]. Here we consider three values: 25%, 50% (as declared by participants of a crowdsourced system monitoring COVID-19-associated behaviors in France [38] ), and 70%. The 70% reduction is considered during lockdown, informed by the reduction of mobility documented during the first weeks of lockdown, and resulting from the analysis of mobile phone data in the region [39] . The percentages associated to telework more generally include all individuals not going to their place of work (because they work remotely, they stopped working due to restrictions, or other conditions). Household contacts are increased proportionally to each adult staying at home based on statistics comparing weekend vs. weekday contacts [17] and proportion of adults working during the weekend [40] . Senior isolation: contacts established by seniors are reduced by a given % to model a marked social distancing targeting only the age class at higher risk of complications. We consider 75% and 90%. Banning of social events and closure of all nonessential activities: Contacts established during leisure and other activities are completely or partially (50%) removed. Case isolation: in a scenario with large-scale and rapid testing availability, we consider that 25%, 50%, or 75% of all infectious individuals (also including asymptomatic) reduce promptly their contacts by 90% throughout their illness as they self-isolate. This simulates the outcome of aggressive contact-tracing and isolation [31, 41] . To account for a delay in tracing, testing, and self-isolation, we consider that infected individuals in their prodromic stage maintain their contacts as in the no-intervention scenario.",

This is due to the smaller fraction of individuals in the population with severe symptoms requiring hospitalization (Additional file 1). If younger children and adolescents are less susceptible than older age classes, transmissions would mainly occur from infectious adults and seniors. A higher transmission rate, with respect to the equal susceptibility scenario, is thus required to reproduce the epidemic trajectory prior to lockdown. This is due to the fact that younger age classes have a large number of contacts, but these contacts become less important in the disease spread if individuals are less susceptible to contract the infection. In the scenario analyses, the reduced susceptibility assumption would lead on average to a higher flux of hospital admissions, as older age classes are the ones with higher probability of being hospitalized. Exit strategies however exist that would maintain the epidemic under control (Additional file 1). Also, changes in the risk of transmission from younger children would lead to similar results. If individuals continue to avoid all physical contacts in the next months, all exit strategies considered here foresee the suppression of the epidemic in the region (Additional file 1).",

Response capacity is critical to lift the lockdown, so that the timeline of these interventions should be carefully planned based on achieved preparedness. We consider different levels of testing capacity starting from the month of May or June. If case isolation is performed on average 1.5 day after infection and is efficient (90% reduction of contacts), we find that identifying at least 50% of all new cases would be required to rapidly reduce the burden on the healthcare system while exiting lockdown. Lower tracing capacity starting May would need to be coupled with more vigorous social distancing to keep the epidemic under control. To release constraints on the population while building capacity, a longer lockdown till June would aid releasing the pressure on the healthcare system. Also, it would be ideal to perform contact tracing and testing while the epidemic is at low activity levels. The benefit of these measures would go beyond the epidemic mitigation and extend to revising and optimizing protocols to improve case finding and isolation-compared to the first phase of the epidemic-under more controlled conditions (reduced mixing of the population).",

As a side effect, lockdown has likely created a forced opportunity to re-organize certain professional activities to make telework possible and efficient at larger scale than previously foreseen. Prior to lockdown, a small fraction of Europeans practiced telework [37] . If this change of paradigm is maintained beyond emergency response, it would be extremely valuable in the medium-to long-term to aid the control of the epidemic below healthcare system saturation.

The fit to the epidemic trajectory, retrospectively performed once data became available, shows that a correction of only 5% in the transmissibility per contact is needed to better describe the epidemic compared to our mechanistically reconstructed matrices.

At the same time, it also suggests that physical contacts were successfully avoided during lockdown, in compliance with the recommendations of health authorities. Second, our predicted reduction of 81% of the average number of contacts during lockdown is lower than the one measured in China in the cities of Wuhan (86%) and Shanghai (89%) [46] . Stricter measures were implemented in China during lockdown compared to Europe, including for example complete suspension of public transport, ban of cars from roads except for the essential services, barring residents from leaving the apartment in certain areas or limiting it to one household member few days per week, performing health checks door to door to identify and isolate ill individuals. These measures are expected therefore to have a more substantial effect on reducing the number of contacts per individual compared to social distancing measures implemented in many European countries. Indeed, under conditions measured in China, the ICU system is predicted by our model to receive less patients and clear them more rapidly than what we currently see in the data. Third, our prediction for contact reduction is close to, but larger than the empirically estimated 73% reduction of a recent social contact survey conducted in the UK during the lockdown phase [45] . Implementation of social distancing however differs in the two countries. For example, in the UK, parks remain open, no self-declaration to circulate is needed, and displacements are not restricted on distance. Assuming the conditions measured in the UK, the model predicts a first peak exceeding ICU capacity. Collecting contact data in France during lockdown, as done in the UK, would allow a better measurement of the mixing patterns altered by social distancing to be compared with our synthetically reconstructed lockdown matrix. Possible changes in population adherence over time, and consequential strengthening of measures by authorities, need however to be taken into account.",

Evidence on seasonal coronaviruses indicates that surgical masks may reduce onward transmission [53] . Masks are largely adopted or enforced in Asia, while they just became a recommended or compulsory protection in certain areas in Europe and the USA, mainly as a precautionary measure [54] . If effective, their widespread use may help decrease the risk of transmission in the community. As more epidemiological evidence accrues, this effect can be taken into account and help further alleviate control measures. We did not consider seasonal behavior in viral transmission [11, 13] , because of current lack of evidence. In our simulated epidemics, multiple peaks are observed because of the implementation of social distancing interventions able to reduce the reproductive number below 1. If seasonal forcing is to be expected, the interplay with seasonality should be carefully considered in the planning of the short-and long-term control strategies [11] . Exit strategies are based on matrices including both physical and non-physical contacts. We saw that excluding physical contacts substantially contributed to the reduction of the reproductive number during lockdown. At this stage, however, large uncertainty exists on recommendations and protocols imposed by authorities to phase out lockdown. Moreover, our scenarios plan out for several months, and recommendations as well as population adoption may strongly change over this long time period. Findings reported in the main text therefore correspond to a conservative choice. If physical contacts are avoided for several months, the epidemic would go locally extinct. Treatment of COVID-19 patients improved over time, as documented by lower probabilities for requiring intensive care and shorter durations in ICU (Additional file 1). These data became available at the time of revision and were not included in the analysis. The more efficient management of COVID-19 patients is expected to reduce the burden in the upcoming months.",

Few studies investigated the clinical progression of symptoms over time until viral clearance. Additional household studies now launched in Europe will help providing a better understanding of the presence of asymptomatic cases and their contribution to transmission. Evidence so far seems to indicate that this fraction may be low [23] ; therefore, we presented in the main paper results for p a = 0.2. Estimates of age-specific severity and case fatality rates are still rapidly evolving and often vary across countries due to different surveillance systems and testing protocols in place. Here we used estimates of age-specific severity informed from a modelbased analysis on individual-level data from China and other countries [19] . Rates describing the hospitalization duration and outcome of a patient were based on French data [28] . Infection fatality ratios estimated by our model are consistent with estimates provided in Ref. [19] . We do not consider here data on comorbidities that will alter hospitalization and fatality rates. Large-scale testing in France will allow us to robustly estimate age-specific hospitalization rates to better inform the model.",
