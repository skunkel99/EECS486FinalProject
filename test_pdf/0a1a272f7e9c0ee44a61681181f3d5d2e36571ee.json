To restrict the spread of the virus pandemic, the Government of India imposed a lockdown from 25 March 2020. In India, Kannur district was identified as the first \"hotspot\" of virus transmission and a \"triple-lockdown\" was implemented for a span of twenty days from 20 April 2020. This article highlights the variations of surface O 3 , NO, NO 2 , CO, SO 2, NH 3 , VOC's, PM 10 , PM 2.5 and meteorological parameters at the time of pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days at Kannur town in south India using ground-based analyzers. From pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days, surface O 3 concentration was found to increase by 22% in this VOC limited environment. NO and NO 2 concentrations were decreased by 61% and 71% respectively. The concentration of PM 10 and PM 2.5 were observed to decline significantly by 61% and 53% respectively. Reduction in PM 10 during lockdown and triple-lockdown days enhanced the intensity of solar radiation reaching the lower troposphere, and increased air temperature and reduced the relative humidity. Owing to this, surface O 3 production over Kannur was found to have increased during triple-lockdown days. The concentration of CO (67%), VOCs (61%), SO 2 (62%) and NH 3 (16%) were found to decrease significantly from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days.

Thus, O 3 increase is due to a lower titration of O 3 by NO due to the strong reduction in local NOx emissions by road transport (Sicard et al., 2020) . However, the presence of VOC's and NOx allows the formation of O 3 through NO 2 photolysis through a complex chemistry (Monks et al., 2015) . The day time average concentrations of (NO 2 /NO) during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days were estimated to be (1.82 \u00b1 0.8 ppbv), (1.38 \u00b1 0.6 ppbv) and (0.86 \u00b1 0.5 ppbv) which indicated a reduction of (NO 2 /NO) by 47% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown days. The ratio between average concentrations of BTEX and NOx were found to be (1.2 \u00b1 1.6 ppbv), (1.65 \u00b1 1.1 ppbv) and (1.96 \u00b1 0.82 ppbv) during pre-lockdown, lockdown and triple-lockdown days respectively; with an increase of 63% from pre-lockdown days to triple-lockdown. During the lockdown period, O 3 lapse rate due to the titration of NO might be less than its photochemical production from its precursors, and this may be the primary reason for the enhancement in O 3 observed. Further, a strong possibility of VOCs emission from home (e.g., cleaning fireplaces, painting) and garden activities (e.g., biomass burning) may also have contributed to the O 3 increase (Su, Mukherjee & Batterman, 2003; Murphy et al., 2007; Wolff, Kahlbaum & Heuss, 2013) in triple-lockdown days. Thus, the reduced concentration in NOx, and any enhancement of biogenic VOC's and their transport may have played a promising role in the enhancement of O 3 during triple-lockdown in Kannur town like other cities, which could be confirmed only after further investigations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 182, "end": 208, "text": "(Beekmann & Vautard, 2010)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 661, "end": 682, "text": "(Sicard et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 804, "end": 824, "text": "(Monks et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1776, "end": 1809, "text": "(Su, Mukherjee & Batterman, 2003;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1810, "end": 1830, "text": "Murphy et al., 2007;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1831, "end": 1861, "text": "Wolff, Kahlbaum & Heuss, 2013)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Diurnal variation of surface O 3 , NO, NO 2"}, {"text": "Diurnal variation of photo-dissociation rate coefficient j(NO 2 ) was computed to estimate the strong dependance of NO 2 on the observed enhancement of O 3, during lockdown and triple-lockdown days as shown in Fig. 2D .
