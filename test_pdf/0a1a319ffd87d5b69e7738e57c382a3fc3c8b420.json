In addition, increased IL-6 may induce 176 apoptosis in lymphocytes, leading to lymphopenia in patients with .

Stimulation of the innate 185 immune system also leads to cytokine release storm. The non-significant difference in IL-6 186 levels between the three groups in our study could be possibly explained by the fact that we 187 assessed the initial laboratory findings of the included patients and so, cytokine release storm 188 might have occurred at later stages of disease in critical patients. Worthy of note, about 10% of 189 the patients in our study had an ESR value of greater than 100 mm/h. Although the main reason 190 for enhanced ESR in inflammatory conditions is increased fibrinogen, an acute phase reactant, 191 albumin also has a suppressive effect on sedimentation; this was confirmed by the significant 192 negative correlation between ESR and albumin levels in this study. From the clinical perspective, 193 COVID-19 could be considered in the differential diagnosis of markedly increased ESR of over 194 100 mm/h. 195 As mentioned earlier, COVID-19-asscoiated coagulopathy (CAC) is a common finding among 196 hospitalized patients (28, 29). In this study, coagulopathy was characterized by elevated D-dimer 197 levels and prolonged PT, INR, and PTT. Patients with COVID-19 suffer from a hypercoagulable 198 state due to several reasons. SARS-CoV-2 can directly cause injury to the endothelial cells, 199 which along with systemic inflammation activates the coagulation cascade (30, 31). Besides, 200 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f patients with hypoxia are more prone to thrombosis due to increased blood viscosity and 201 stimulation of hypoxia-inducible factors (32).",
