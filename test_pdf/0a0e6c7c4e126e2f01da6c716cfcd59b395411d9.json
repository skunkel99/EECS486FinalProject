Given that the COVID-19 pandemic shows important geographic variation in its prevalence and mortality, Delanghe et al (1) hypothesized that genetic variation of the host might, at least in part, explain the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection. They analyzed the geographic variation of a number of immune system-related human plasma protein polymorphisms and reported that the ACE1*D allele frequency correlated negatively with COVID-19 prevalence and positively with COVID-19-associated mortality. The other investigated polymorphisms, including the F and S alleles of complement C3, the C282Y mutation in homeostatic iron regulator HFE, the Hp1 and Hp2 alleles of haptoglobin, and the DBP1 and DBP2 alleles of vitamin D binding protein, did not significantly correlate with COVID-19 prevalence or mortality (2) .",

CCR5 is a receptor for proinflammatory chemokines that play key roles in host responses, especially to viruses. Furthermore, CCR5 expressed on various cell types plays a vital role in the inflammatory response by directing cells to sites of inflammation. The 32-bp deletion mutation in the CCR5 coding region (CCR5-\u039432) prevents receptor expression on the cell surface and leaves homozygous individuals without functional CCR5.",
