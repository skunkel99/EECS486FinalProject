Over the past two decades, most radiology departments have had to deal with unplanned downtimes of their critical systems, such as the picture archiving and communication system (PACS). Because of the relative frequency of these downtimes, most radiology departments have documented downtime policies and procedures. These policies and procedures have variable levels of detail and are used to help guide radiology department staff when a system is not functioning to its desired state. Additionally, most hospitals have purchased and installed disaster recovery and business continuity solutions for their critical systems [8] [9] [10] [11] . Unfortunately, unplanned system downtimes are a relatively frequent occurrence in many radiology departments. These unplanned downtimes are often the result of a small number of system issues and may cause or contribute to enterprise-wide issues. Thus, radiology department staff are adept at maintaining operations while their critical systems are not functioning, and information technology staff are skilled at fixing the underlying system issue. Because radiology staff are used to this type of unplanned downtime and have dealt with it frequently, we have anecdotally found that many departments have become complacent and have not planned for other downtime or disaster scenarios.",

In 2010, we had replaced our first PACS and, with the replacement, we had installed a true business continuity system with duplicate copies of images. Over the next 8 years, we worked to refine our business continuity process and eliminate even planned downtime. This effort was successful, and we had operated for several years without an unplanned PACS downtime. That changed when a standard server operating system security patch was incompatible with the PACS application and caused both our production and business continuity environments to fail within minutes of each other. This led to an extended downtime of more than 10 h. While we were able to manage the downtime, we realized that we had not planned for such a scenario and were thus unprepared in many ways. Over the ensuing 2 years, we have implemented a more formal disaster planning process and have solved many of the issues we faced on that day. Collaborative exercises, such as tabletop disaster scenarios, have helped us to identify holes in our disaster processes and address them in our policies and procedures. While we realize that we cannot predict every scenario, this more formal planning process has allowed us to be more prepared when a true disaster strikes. The purpose of this manuscript is to describe the phases of disaster response and how we have organized our radiology information technology disaster planning around these phases. Throughout this manuscript, we will share examples of how this planning influenced our preparations and response to the SARS-CoV-2/COVID pandemic. It does not encompass all of the work that occurred in the department related to our technical staff and patient care.",

The purpose of the mitigation phase is to implement systems or solutions to minimize the impact of a disaster [1] . Mitigation systems can include early warning or notification systems as well as solutions to address the disaster itself. For example, hospitals uniformly implement multiple solutions to mitigate against the impact of a fire. Smoke detectors and heat sensors couple with an alerting system to provide an early warning to hospital employees that a fire is present. Once a fire is detected, these early notification systems trigger multiple responses to minimize the danger and destruction of a fire. The triggered responses include sprinkler systems, door closures, evacuation orders, and notification of a local fire department.",

At the outset, we were concerned about system performance related to the network speeds through the hospital virtual private network (VPN), the ability of radiologists to add the system to their home, and the ability of the radiology informatics team to decommission the workstations from the reading room and deploy them to the radiologists. With regards to system performance, we were specifically concerned with two systems, the PACS (Merge Halo; IBM Watson Health Imaging; Fig. 1 a Graphic showing the typical representation of the disaster planning process as a cycle. b During the SARS-CoV-2/COVID pandemic, we have found the process to be less of a cycle but more of an interconnected web with each phase informing each of the other phases Cambridge, MA) and the voice-dictation system (PowerScribe 360; Nuance Communications; Burlington, MA). The PACS downloads images before allowing the user to view the study. This occurs in one of two methods. Most studies are cached to the disk-based on their presence on the reading worklist. While pre-caching may be slower over VPN through a home internet service provider, we believed that this solution would allow for adequate performance. However, we remained concerned about ad-hoc queries for studies not on the worklist. For those studies, the image download begins when the study is opened. The dictation software provided a different challenge. From prior experience, we knew that having the user's voice profile on the system's server added a delay to the signing process of each dictation. We knew that we could address this by copying the user's voice file to the PACS workstation and making a system configuration change. To test this solution, the radiologist informatics leader (AJT) brought a PACS workstation home and evaluated system performance. While performance was acceptable, we expected performance to degrade as the pandemic struck because we anticipated that there would be a spike in network traffic and VPN usage with more employees working from home. The radiology informatics team worked with the hospital network team to discuss options for dedicated VPN traffic or ensuring that the potential number of VPN connections and bandwidth could be increased.",

First, we knew that radiologists would not know how to setup a PACS workstation and its diagnostic monitors. Thus, we created detailed how-to instructions for system setup and labeled workstations, cables, and monitors. This allowed us to promote social distancing for the radiology informatics team members rather than have the team members travel to private radiologist residences. The radiologist informatics leader tested these instructions when he brought the system to his house. Additionally, the informatics team knew that some radiologists would not be able to provide a wired connection to their router. Thus, the team researched and procured wireless adapters for the PACS workstations. The radiologist informatics leader evaluated system performance at his house with both wired and wireless connections. The radiologist informatics leader felt like there was a noticeable degradation in the performance of the PACS using the wireless adapter. However, even with performance degradation, the solution was felt to be feasible and sufficient to perform standard work tasks.",

Our department was fortunate to have enough PACS workstations so that each faculty radiologist and fellow could take a machine home. However, this would leave less than five machines in the department. The team anticipated that it would take at least 30 min to decommission each machine. The decommissioning process would involve shutting down the computer, unplugging each input, labeling each connection and cable, and safely packaging the different components. We anticipated that this process would take 20-25 person-hours to complete but could be distributed amongst multiple members of the team. To prepare for this process, we procured bubble wrap and cardboard to protect the monitors and plastic bags to better transport the cables. Additionally, we discussed a schedule of how we could rapidly decommission the workstations.",

However, our 9 fellows work in a shared space that would not allow for appropriate distancing. Thus, we had to identify spaces for the fellows to work. We solved this by commandeering offices from our overnight and emeritus faculty, using several ancillary reading spaces that were traditionally used for research or training, and by using the office of a faculty member who had recently left the department.",

However, in July, the department believed that the training of our new fellows would suffer if the radiologists continued to work in isolation. This belief was couple with new evidence that mask wearing and social distancing could help to prevent transmission of the virus. Based on these two pieces of information, we planned and implemented a partial move back to the reading room. As we made this move the informatics team worked to maintain distancing in the reading rooms by limiting the number of workstations and maximizing distance between two workstations. The team also identified new spaces and converted them to reading rooms, making sure that network jacks were active, any windows had black-out curtains, and that desks and chairs were available. This partial move allowed most radiologists to move from working in their offices or at home to working from the reading room. Because we were not able to create enough space for all services to co-locate at least two radiologists (a faculty and a trainee), radiologists on some services continue to work from their office or from home.
