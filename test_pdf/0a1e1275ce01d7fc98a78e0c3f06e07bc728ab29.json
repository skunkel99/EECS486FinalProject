Although fewer colonoscopies were conducted amongst referred patients, the pick-up rate for CRC reassuringly increased in our examined cohort with a consistent case yield compared to previous years. This suggests that our secondary care triage system is more effective at identifying patients for colonoscopy, and may be a potential model for the 28-day faster diagnostic service (FDS). This 'COVID model' avoids lengthy diagnostic delays through prompt decisions at initial triage to accept or remove patients from the pathway, thereby enabling rapid access to, yet reducing overall pressure on, diagnostic services, the continued expansion of which is unsustainable.",

Concerns remain for its potential long-term ramifications given the significant reduction in GP referrals and investigations performed during this period. This may in future result in patients receiving a delayed diagnosis and an increase in emergency presentations due to complications of advanced disease that would otherwise have been identified through usual diagnostic pathways. Furthermore, by discharging 'lowrisk' patients at source, we may miss early or minimally symptomatic cancers which would again otherwise be identified through colonoscopy or CT colonography 5 . This risk may be mitigated through more routine use of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in both primary and secondary care with recent studies indicating a high diagnostic yield for cancer when a lower test cut-off is used 6 .",

This pathway will likely remain relevant during the post-COVID-19 recovery period whilst the risk of a second wave of infections persists, given the clear advantage of faster time to triage and potential definitive investigations and treatments. Combining this service with more sensitive point-of-care tests holds potential as a model for the FDS by avoiding unnecessary referrals and excessive investigations whilst maintaining diagnostic yield and conserving face-to-face",
