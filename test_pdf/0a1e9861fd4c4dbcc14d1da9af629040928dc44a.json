Abstract: the authors described some irrelevant information, such as the symptoms and information of COVID-19, which are the common knowledge now and the authors didn't directly study those issues in their study.

The process of changing CPAP/NIV to HFNC is not clear. Did they change from CPAP/NIV to HFNC for whoever met the failure criteria? what's the failure criteria? if it is the criteria listed before this sentence \"A single attempt lasting a maximum of one hour was performed when SpO2 was less than 92%, RR higher than 28 acts/min, dyspnoea was present, and contraindications including cardiorespiratory arrest, signs of organ failure, hemodynamic instability, facial trauma, and upper airway obstruction were absent.11\" any of the contraindication listed here is definitely contraindication for HFNC, those patients need direct intubation, how can it be possible to switch to HFNC? if this is not the criteria, please list.",

Paragraph 2 is confusing, did you use HFNC for 2 patients directly and switched from conventional oxygen therapy to HFNC for 3 patients? Then you said \"CPAP treatment was tried in all 5 patients\", when did you use CPAP? Also, did you use CPAP or BiPAP? c.
