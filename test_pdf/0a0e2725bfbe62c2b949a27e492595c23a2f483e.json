The residency application 67 process is changing rapidly in response to an increasingly complex and competitive atmosphere, 68 with wider recognition of the stress, expense, and difficulty of matching into graduate training 69 programs. The COVID-19 pandemic and societal upheaval make this application cycle more 70 challenging than ever before. Medical students need reliable, accurate, honest advising from 71 faculty in their field of choice in order to apply successfully to residency. The authors outline a 72 model for faculty career advisors, distinct from mentors or general academic advisors. The 73 faculty career advisor has detailed knowledge about the field, an in-depth understanding of the 74 application process and what constitutes a strong application. The faculty career advisor 75 provides accurate information regarding residency programs within the specialty, helping 76 students to strategically apply to programs where the student is likely to match, decreasing 77 anxiety, expense and over-application. Faculty career advisor teams advise students throughout 78 the application process with periodic review of student portfolios and are available for support 79 and advice throughout the process.

These 112 websites are updated at least annually and provide a comprehensive view of the application 113 process, as well as updates on current conditions. The APGO OBGYN Residency Directory 114 provides a concise listing and comparison of residency programs, a vital resource for students 115 and advisors.

Students should request a LOR at the time they work 203 with the author and meet to review their portfolio. Students should be mindful of the time 204 required to write LORs and request letters early enough to meet deadlines. 205 Personal Statement 206 The FCA plays a critical role in reviewing the personal statement (PS). 42 Although the PS 207is the only place in the application where the student's voice is heard, students often struggle 208 with writing. 42-44 A reflection exercise to identify strengths, weaknesses, career goals and 209 desired program characteristics leads to a well-organized, effective PS. 42 210",

            "text": "Applicants increased from 1335 in 228 2010, to 2026 in 2019. 30 In 2020, there were 1413 PGY-1 spots, with 1.12 positions for each US 229 applicant. 30,59 230 Assessing Competitiveness 231 The FCA can help students assess their competitiveness in comparison with classmates 232 and with the entire applicant field. 26 To ensure adequate interviews for all students, FCA's 233 should advise students to apply strategically based on attributes valued at different programs, 234 as residency programs often interview only a few candidates per school. This requires FCA 235 teams to work collaboratively, equitably advising all applicants, are underway to simplify the application process. 60 In 2019, OBGYN 240 became the first specialty to recommend residency programs limit the number of invitations 241 extended to only the number of interviews available, standardize invitation dates, and give a 242 realistic response time to accept invitations. 60 243 244 Program Director's Perspective 245 Attributes Considered in Granting Interviews 246 PD's most frequently cite USMLE Step 1 scores as a factor in offering interviews, as 247 standardized tests are viewed as an objective measure of academic achievement and potential 248 for completing residency and passing licensing exams. 61 Most programs do not specify a 249 required Step 1 score, however in 2019 the median score for matched applicants was 229 250 (inter-quartile range, 218-240). 61 For less academically competitive candidates, including Step 2 251 scores in the initial application may boost chances for an interview. Other factors cited include 252 LORs, Step 2 scores, PS, and the MSPE. 30,59 Grades, class rank, publications, research, work or 253 volunteer experiences are less commonly cited factors. 254 In 2019 NBME announced Step 1 will become pass/fail; 62 the effects of this change are 255 uncertain, but may prompt the use of holistic reviews, and may change recommendations for 256 number of applications to submit. 6 257 Attributes Considered in Ranking 258 communication skills as the most important attribute. 61 While academic excellence is often 260 required to receive interviews, interpersonal skills are the deciding factor in ranking candidates. 261 In 2020, all interviews will be virtual. Although concerns exist this will adversely affect 262 perceptions of communication skills, 63 a pilot study in anesthesiology comparing virtual and 263 face-to-face interviews reported no difference in matching results. 64 264 265 The Application Process 266 Applying to Residency Programs: Which Ones and How Many? 267 Applying for residency is expensive and time-consuming. For OBGYN in 2019, students 268 submitted a mean of 61.3 applications, while programs received an average of 438.1 total 269",

            "text": "Couples should 332 decide whether they are willing to train in different geographic locations or if either is willing to 333 delay training for a year. Couples should turn in their rank order lists early, as both applicants' 334 lists will be rejected if there are discrepancies, and must be resubmitted in time for the 335 deadline. 61 336 337 Supplemental Offer and Acceptance Process (SOAP) 338 Students are notified of match status on Monday of Match week. Applicants who have 339 not matched may then enter SOAP. Residency programs with open slots can contact students 340 directly during SOAP. Students, or their representatives, may not initiate contact prior to 3 pm 341EST on that Monday, and must go through ERAS to contact programs.67  Applicants in violation 342 of the NRMP rules can be barred from future participation in the Match.343 In the immediate post-match time frame, the FCA can offer support for the unmatched releases a list of unfilled programs. The FCA can assist the applicant in identifying programs as 347 FCAs may learn of open positions in the specialty before general advisors. 68 If an applicant does 348 not match through the traditional match but obtains a preliminary position, the FCA should 349 maintain contact, and offer to review a second application. 68,69 350 351 Effects of COVID-19 352 In response to the pandemic, most American medical schools suspended educational 353 and research activities in March 2020, resulting in decreased opportunities for students to 354 prepare for residency. Changes in the application cycle were instituted by the AAMC, while 355 APGO/CREOG recommended OBGYN specific changes. (Table 2). 6,70,71 356 As Ferrell and Ryan noted in April 2020, \"The panic in the community is palpable, and 357 many are confused by how to proceed in the wake of COVID-19\" as the normal methods for 358 demonstrating achievement are severely limited. 72 Students may face added stress from 359 societal upheaval, family illness, financial stress, and rising inequities. In light of the pandemic, 360 virtual mentor relationships such as FCA's remain the educational intervention most desired by 361 students. 73 APGO/CREOG specifically recommend students work with an FCA during this 362 application cycle. 41,74 FCAs should review recent general and OBGYN-specific changes to the 363 application process to accurately advise students. 6,60 . New FCA roles in 2020 include virtual 364 interview preparation and electronic networking. 63 365 FCA teams should update local student resources regularly. Medical schools should provide 369 current data, including programs where students have recently matched. FCA groups may 370conduct informal surveys or focus groups of graduates to elicit hard-to-capture data regarding 371 student experiences. 372Faculty Development 373The FCA is a novel role evolving to meet the needs of students during the residency 374 application process. The pool of faculty serving as FCAs may vary from school to school, 375 including subspecialists. While no formal training programs exist, APGO and other specialty 376 societies have published resources to assist faculty members as they develop the skills needed 377 to successfully serve as FCAs.18-22, 26,42  Online resources are listed inTable 1. FCA teams can 378 improve advising through standardized programs, sharing best practices, case-based critical 379 review of recent student experiences and reflection on their own experiences to inform 380 advising style and substance.75 381Continuous Quality Improvement 382 FCA teams should meet annually after the Match to debrief, inviting administrative staff 383 who often have a different perspective on student experiences. Recently, evaluation tools for 384 UME programs have been published and may be used to identify and adopt best practices.",
