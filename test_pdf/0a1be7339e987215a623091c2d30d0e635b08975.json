Their temporal response gives information about the presence of a biochemical/biological analyte, its concentration and its interactions with the adsorption sites (which may be an integral part of the surface itself or immobilized functionalizing molecules). Mathematical models of the temporal response taking into account as many relevant effects as possible are essential for obtaining reliable information. We present a novel model taking into account the bimodal affinity of a sensing surface (adsorption occurs on two distinct site types), and the adsorption-caused depletion of the analyte from the sample. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the analyte depletion influence on the bimodal adsorption, and of the influence of the sensing surface inhomogeneity on the sensor temporal response, for different analyte concentrations and different fractions of two types of adsorption sites. Since the presented mathematical model deals with the realistic cases of the sensing surface non-uniformity and the finite amount of analyte present in the sensor reaction chamber, it enables improved accuracy in interpreting the measurement data. Our results are general, i.e. valid for any adsorption sensor (microcantilevers, plasmonics) and for arbitrary sensor dimensions.",

Among them are the affinity-based micro/nanosensors that make use of reversible adsorption of target analyte particles as a mechanism of the analyte recognition and sensor response generation (Rogers and Mulchandani 1998) . Examples include microcantilever or nanocantilever-based MEMS sensors (Hansen and Thundat 2005) and plasmonic devices that utilize evanescent surface electromagnetic waves (Choi and Choi 2011) . The affinity-based micro and nanosystem sensors ensure extremely sensitive, real-time, label-free, in situ and low-cost detection and measurement of the analyte concentrations in samples taken from the environment, food or living organisms (Ram and Bhethanabotla 2018; Zhou et al. 2017; Khanna 2012) . Owing to their small dimensions, such devices are suitable for sensor networks and portable sensors with wireless communication (Bhushan and Sahoo 2020) , in which the sensing element, electronic signal processing circuitry and a wireless transceiver can be integrated into a small volume (Eren 2018) . These features make the affinity-based micro/nanosensors promising tools for applications in environmental monitoring, agriculture, food industry, biomedical diagnostics and early warning systems for bioterrorism (Khanna 2012; Eren 2018; Kim and Lee 2020) . Even in this very moment, plasmonic biological sensors are used to enable rapid and massive testing of COVID-19 suspect individuals-e.g. (Qiu et al. 2020; Morales-Narv\u00e1ez and Dincer 2020) .",

Alternatively, a somewhat more comprehensive model is used that takes into account the coupling of AD process and mass transfer in the sensor microfluidic chamber (Myszka et al. 1998; Anderson et al. 2011 ). Some models have been presented in literature that include competitive adsorption of binary or multiple analytes (Jak\u0161i\u0107 et al. 2010 (Jak\u0161i\u0107 et al. , 2014a Frantlovi\u0107 et al. 2013) , dealing in such a manner with the limited sensor selectivity. There are also models that take into account multiple analyte adsorption and mass transfer (Frantlovi\u0107 et al. 2013) . In sensors with a closed reaction chamber, the depletion of analyte particles from the sample as a consequence of their adsorption over time can also be important, since it influences the sensor temporal response, especially at low analyte concentrations. This effect was taken into account in the non-linear mathematical model in Jak\u0161i\u0107 et al. (2014b Jak\u0161i\u0107 et al. ( , 2020 .

The reason for that may be a non-uniform surface morphology, or uneven binding of functionalizing particles to the surface.

In a general case, different weight factors may correspond to the adsorption on two types of binding sites (the response is then S l = w 1 N 1l ? w 2 N 2l ). A motivation for the use of Eq. (8) is its validity for many various adsorption-based sensors in the case when there are different types of adsorption sites. For instance, in the cases of resonant micro/nanocantilevers, surface acoustic wave and bulk acoustic wave sensors, particle adsorption changes the mass of the mechanical sensing structure, so that w is determined by the mass of a single analyte particle, thus it is independent on the type of the site where the particle was adsorbed. Also, in the case of plasmonic sensors it is reasonable to assume that the mean change of refractive index when an analyte particle is adsorbed is w = (nn e )/N a , where n is the refractive index value of the analyte and n e is the refractive index of the surrounding medium (Choy 2015) (the simple mixing rule). A more comprehensive model takes into account the change of the number of free particles in the chamber due to the AD processes on the surface.

Figures 2 and 3 also show that adsorption on lowaffinity sites contributes more to the sensor response at higher analyte concentrations: for C = 3 9 10 18 1/m 3 (Fig. 2) this component amounts to about 43% of the steady-state sensor response, compared to about 25% response at a 5 times lower concentration (Fig. 3) . It is observed that the duration of the transient regime response, and thus the response time of the sensor itself, may be significantly longer than it would correspond to adsorption on higher affinity sites. Figures 2 and 3 illustrate that improper modeling, which neglects the depletion in the analyte concentration and the surface inhomogeneity, could give false results in both the transient and the steady state sensor response analysis. Figure 4 shows the steady-state number of particles adsorbed on each of the two types of adsorption sites (N 1s , N 2s ), as well as the total number of the particles adsorbed on the sensing surface (N s = N 1s ? N 2s ) for various values of the fraction of type 1 adsorption sites, v, when analyte depletion is taken into account. The parameters of the bimodal surface affinity are the same as before, and the analyte concentration is C = 6 9 10 17 m -3 (corresponds to a number of N 0 = 6 9 10 10 particles in a chamber of volume 10 -7 m 3 ). Figure 4 enables one to get quantitative insight into the influence of the nonuniformity of the binding sites to the sensor response in the steady state. The domination of the adsorption at the high affinity sites over the low affinity sites adsorption, starts already with fractions of the type 1 sites near 0.26. One can also observe in Fig. 4 a fast decrease of the sensor response with an increase of the fraction of the type 2 sites, from the maximum response (when all the sites are type 1, and the number of the adsorbed particles is 3 9 10 10 ). For instance, at v = 0.6 the response is about 20% lower. By comparing the curves obtained using the two models and shown in the same diagram, one can observe the influence of analyte depletion on response for different values of v. It can be seen that with an increase of the fraction of sites of the given type the error in the number of adsorbed particles at this type of sites increases, if the number is determined by the model neglecting analyte depletion.",

Adsorption on the high affinity sites dominates after v exceeds the value of about 0.43, according to both models. A seemingly counter-intuitive high percentage of the adsorption on the low-affinity sites is explained by a high coverage of the high-affinity sites (near to 95%), which decreases the probability of adsorption on them. This high percentage of adsorption at the low affinity (type 2) sites is the key reason for a lower than expected decrease of the sensor response at high analyte concentrations. So Fig. 4 Steady-state numbers of particles adsorbed on surface sites of high affinity (i.e. type 1 sites), of low affinity (i.e. type 2 sites), and on both types of adsorption sites, for different fractions of sites of the two types, which is characterized by the parameter v (the fraction of sites of type 1), according to the model that neglects analyte depletion (''No Depletion'' curves) , and the other that takes it into account (''Depletion'' curves). The arrows point out to the values of v for which the type of sites with dominant adsorption changes Fig. 5 The same parameters as in Fig. 4 , but for 10 times lower analyte concentration for instance when 40% of the adsorption sites are type 2 (v = 0.6), the response is decreased by about 5% (compared to a 20% decrease for the same value of v, as shown in Fig. 4 for a ten times lower concentration). Figure 6 shows the same variables as presented in Figs. 4 and 5, but for different analyte concentrations, when the percentage of the low affinity sites is higher that that of the high affinity sites (v = 0.35). The more accurate model, which takes into account analyte depletion, shows that at concentrations below about 1.6 9 10 18 m -3 a majority of the adsorbed particles are those bound to the higher affinity sites, although those comprise 35% of the total number of sites.

Using these two models we analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the influence of different fractions of high-and low-affinity sites on the sensor response.",

The smaller the physical features of the device are, the stronger will be the influence of adsorption phenomena on its performance, since the same number of the adsorbed particle will make the larger relative change of the overall properties of the features. Fig. 6 Numbers of adsorbed particles on the sites of high affinity (type 1 sites), of low affinity sites (sites of the type 2), and the total number of adsorbed particles in steady state, for different analyte concentrations, nd v = 0.35 (v is the fraction of high-affinity sites in the total number of the binding sites at the sensing surface). The results are obtained by using the two mathematical models: the one neglects analyte depletion (''No Depletion'' curves) , and the other takes it into account (''Depletion'' curves). The arrows point out to the values of C for which the type of sites with dominant adsorption changes",
