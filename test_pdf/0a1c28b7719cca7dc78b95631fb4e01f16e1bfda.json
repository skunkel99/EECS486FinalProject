            "text": "Prevention is better than cure and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be possible. In elderly persons who are cognitively normal, synaptic hypometabolism as shown by reduced cerebral uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18 F-FDG), provides a premonitory signal of potential, future loss of cognition if those individuals also have present evidence of amyloid deposition seen in the Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) scan for amyloid. Those are the persons who should be targeted if one aims to prevent AD. The synaptic hypometabolism implies that the brain's availability of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is inadequate for performance of all required synaptic functions. This review first describes the basis for asserting that reduced cerebral uptake of 18 F-FDG accurately reflects synaptic hypometabolism; second, explains the basis for asserting that hypometabolism implies inadequate ATP; third, shows that amyloid beta (A\u03b2) itself, A\u03b2 modified by pyroglutamate to become a molecule termed pE(3)A\u03b2, and cyclophilin-D, in concert are the main contributors to inadequate synaptic ATP and that, therefore, reducing all of their levels would neutralize their combined effect and correct the hypometabolism. pE(3)A\u03b2 is more neurotoxic than unmodified A\u03b2; and cyclophilin D inhibits ATP synthase and reduces ATP formation. Finally, this review describes an mRNA self-replicating vaccine that will raise brain levels of ATP by reducing A\u03b2, pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2, and cyclophilin-D, and thereby-in cognitively normal elderly persons who have synaptic hypometabolismprevent initiation of the process that terminates in AD.",

            "text": "early use of anti-inflammatory drugs; and it is widely recognized that treatment for human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) should begin immediately when the diagnosis is made. The concept by Hardy and Higgins, 1 and Selkoe 2 that the primary cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is cerebral amyloid or its oligomers, was based upon rational analysis of the facts known at the time. The most likely reason why, subsequently, so many trials based upon the amyloid hypothesis have failed either to reverse or halt AD, is because once the causal process is in motion it may be unstoppable due to the known multiplicity of abnormalities of the brain in AD, many of which are also present at the earlier stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). On the other hand, it may be possible to prevent AD before it has even commenced, which is the time when there is not yet cognitive loss but when amyloid is detectable by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PIB-PET) scan and when synaptic metabolism as shown by fluorodeoxyglucose PET ( 18 F-FDG-PET) scan is reduced. 3 That condition has been termed pre-clinical AD. 4 Because synapses account for a large portion of the brain's energy use, an immediate question is whether preventing this reduction of neuronal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) might prevent the start of cognitive loss in predisposed persons. This article will first describe the basis for asserting the presence of synaptic hypometabolism before cognitive loss has appeared. Second, it will describe the basis for asserting that hypometabolism, as shown by low uptake of 18 F-FDG, implies inadequate synaptic ATP. Third, it will show that amyloid beta (A\u03b2) itself, pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2, and cyclophilin-D are, in concert, the main contributors to inadequate synaptic ATP and, therefore, that reducing their input would neutralize their combined effect and correct that hypometabolism. Finally, it will describe a self-replicating, mRNA vaccine that will reduce the levels of A\u03b2, pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2, and cyclophilin-D, thereby preventing the process that terminates in AD.",

Each of these actions will be explained below but first is an explanation of how pyroglutamate modifies A\u03b2. The modification occurs because, mediated by the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase, pyroglutamic acid truncates and caps the A\u03b2 oligomeric peptide at position #3 of its N-terminus sequence. That position is occupied by glutamate (E), and pyroglutamate (p) attaches to E, forming a molecule that is written as pE (3)A\u03b2 (sometimes written as pGlu3-A\u03b2, or A\u03b2pGlu3, or A\u03b2 N3(pE) ; whatever its description in the various cited reports, it will, for uniformity, be written here as pE (3) Their In brief, the reduction of pE(3)A\u03b2 levels would be beneficial for elderly individuals who are at risk of future loss of cognition. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in AD, which would produce lipid peroxidation, has been known for many years. 34 37 Thus, reducing cyclophilin D negated its deleterious consequence of excessively raising Ca 2+ . Cyclophilin D also binds ANT, which is another way whereby cyclophilin D reduces ATP. 38 Giorgio et al. showed that binding to the F 0 F 1 -ATP synthase and impairing its enzymatic activity is yet another mechanism by which cyclophilin D decreases the synthesis of ATP. 39 ATP synthase is organized into supramolecular units called synthasomes that increase the efficiency of ATP production, and Beutner et al.",

The energy of this concentration gradient is the so-called proton motive force (\u0394\u03a8). 42, 46 \u0394\u03a8 is regulated by the Ca 2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix, where the net level of Ca 2+ is the difference between Ca 2+ uptake and its extrusion: uptake is via the mitochondrial Ca 2+ uniporter (MCU) transporting Ca 2+ into the mitochondrial matrix: the main extrusion pathway is the Na + /Ca 2+ exchanger pumping Ca 2+ from the matrix, back into the intermembrane space. Wescott et al. described experiments on isolated mitochondria that elucidated the main mechanisms involved in ATP formation, for which the three critical components are ADP (the substrate), Ca 2+ (the regulator), and \u0394\u03a8 (the energy source). 45 By using isolated mitochondria and controlling the levels of Ca 2+ , Wescott et al. showed that Ca 2+ regulates mitochondrial use of carbohydrates and amino acids in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and through this regulation, increased Ca 2+ powered by \u0394\u03a8, augments ATP production. If, however, the Ca 2+ concentration in the mitochondrial matrix becomes excessive, Ca 2+ may then cause the MPTP to swell and open; when that happens, the inner mitochondrial membrane can no longer maintain a barrier to protons, leading to dissipation of the proton motive force, that is, \u0394\u03a8 m , and now there is uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced formation of ATP. 47, 48 Further, extrusion of excessive Ca 2+ requires ATP and causes its further depletion. 49 Those high levels of Ca 2+ may be prevented by dantrolene, discussed in detail in ",

The resulting proteins are antigens expressed at a high level due to the amplification effect of the RNA template, and these replicons cannot produce infectious virions because the gene for the structural protein of the virus has been deleted. Cells replicate, including neurons and glia, and the daughter cells maintain the parental molecular biology. A self-amplifying mRNA vaccine would produce a longlasting effect and should protect the individual for many years from synaptic dysfunction, whereas a traditional vaccine would produce an effect of far shorter duration. Another major advantage of mRNA vaccines is that by targeting multiple antigens they minimize the number of oral drugs needed.",

Du et al. demonstrated accumulation of unmodified A\u03b2 in mitochondria, 17 where Singh et al. showed that it may cause synaptic hypometabolism by preventing the release of ATP into the neuronal cytoplasm. 18 Singh et al. performed multiple computer simulations using programs that judge subcellular locations of proteins as well as the likelihood of protein-protein interactions. Those showed A\u03b2 as forming a very stable complex with adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT). Both unmodified A\u03b2 and pyroglutamate-modified A\u03b2 are abundant in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where A\u03b2 interacts with ANT. The readeris reminded that the mitochondrion has an outer membrane, an inner membrane, the intermembrane space between those two membranes, and a space deep to the inner membrane that is called the matrix. Protrusions from the inner mitochondrial membranes into the matrix form the cristae. The function of ANT is to transport adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP through an exchange-diffusion mechanism. During oxidative phosphorylation, ADP in the neuronal cytosol crosses the external mitochondrial membrane via the voltage-dependent anion channel and enters the mitochondrial matrix; in exchange, ATP is released from the matrix into the intermembrane space and thence across the outer membrane into the neuronal cytosol. However, because of the ANT-A\u03b2 interaction there is reduced availability of both ANT and ADP, so the availability of ATP is also reduced, which contributes to synaptic hypometabolism.18,19",

Harigaya et al. showed that pE(3)A\u03b2 in the AD brain comprises \u224825% of the total A\u03b2, but that in senile plaques, pE(3)A\u03b2 forms oligomers at a concentration of 1mcg/ml whereas for A\u03b2 1-42 2.5 mcg/ml was required. 20 Data demonstrate that pE(3)A\u03b2 is highly enriched in the AD brain, particularly in the subcortical regions that are affected in AD. Morawski et al. examined brain tissue from 13 non-demented controls and 11 AD cases, using immunohistochemistry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and enzymatic activity assays for the expression level of glutaminyl cyclase in temporal and entorhinal cortex; they also measured cortical pE(3)A\u03b2 concentrations. 21 In AD brains, glutaminyl cyclase mRNA expression was increased and frequently associated with pE(3)A\u03b2 deposits. The peptide was shown by G\u00fcntert et al. as being far more strongly accumulated during progression of AD than unmodified A\u03b2, which actually decreased, demonstrating the disease-driving role of pE(3)A\u03b2. 22 They did this by using a lysyl endopeptidase to digest cored plaques from five individuals with AD and analyzed the resultant peptides with various, very sensitive laboratory techniques including time of flight mass spectrometry. They examined levels of peptides having similar lengths but that were derived from either unmodified A\u03b2 or pE(3)A\u03b2. Following enzymatic digestion, A\u03b2 1-16 was the predominant unmodified type and they examined levels of that in contrast to those of pE(3)A\u03b23-16; the two molecules have almost identical ionization properties so their levels are comparable.",

Another benefit of raising ATP levels is that heat-shock proteins 70 and 40 inhibit the self-assembly of pE(3)A\u03b2 into fibrils in a reaction that requires ATP. 35,36 In brief, both A\u03b2 and pE(3)A\u03b2 lower ATP levels, and increasing them would be beneficial for elderly individuals who are at risk of future loss of cognition because of synaptic hypometabolism caused by reduced levels of ATP. Cyclophilin D in the mitochondrial matrix translocates to the inner mitochondrial membrane to collaborate with ATP synthase subunit 9 to open the mitochondrial permeability transition pore that results (see next section) in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and reduced formation of ATP. Baines et al. generated mice overexpressing cyclophilin D, which caused them to have mitochondrial swelling and cell death. 37 Several reports have demonstrated that reducing the level of cyclophilin D enhances production of ATP, which clearly would be advantageous for persons with synaptic hypometabolism. Cyclophilin D is a product of the Pfif gene, and Baines et al. also created Pfif null mice, the homozygotes of which produced no cyclophilin D and whose heterozygotes produced half-normal levels; those mice had mitochondria resistant to both swelling and opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) caused by Ca 2+ .",

In brief: in the presence of high mitochondrial Ca 2+ levels, there is both decreased formation and increased use of ATP. The decrease of ATP, particularly in CA1 synapses, would lessen if cyclophilin D were reduced by, for example, a vaccine. Mg + participates in several ways in the regulation of ATP production by the mitochondria: first, because the mitochondria are major pools of Mg + ; second, because both Mg + and Ca 2+ levels in the mitochondrial matrix affect mitochondrial dehydrogenases and, therefore, mitochondrial respiration rate; and third, because an increase in Mg + antagonizes opening of the MPTP, this counters the effect of excessive mitochondrial Ca 2 . For these reasons, in clinical practice, Mg + levels should be kept at the upper levels of the normal range, by use of oral supplementation.7 A MULTIVALENT COLLABORATION AMONG A\u03b2, PE(3)A\u03b2, ATP SYNTHASE, AND CYCLOPHILIN DA constellation of unmodified A\u03b2, pE(3)A\u03b2, and cyclophilin D participates in a multivalent collaboration that lessens the effect of ATP synthase and eventuates in reduced formation of ATP. Because it is not unmodified A\u03b2 alone but a collaboration with its pE(3)A\u03b2 variant that participates in the multivalent collaboration, it seems possible that this explains the failure of so many attempts, including by various vaccines, to demonstrate benefit to AD from reducing the amount of A\u03b2. A vaccine that not only reduces A\u03b2 but also reduces pE(3)A\u03b2 and cyclophilin D, would result in increased neuronal ATP and decrease the synaptic impairment caused by inadequate ATP. Such a vaccine should be beneficial for cognitively normal elderly persons who have synaptic hypometabolism (and potentially, also, for MCI/AD patients). The concept may be tested in animal trials and if those were successful, then ultimately in clinical trials in humans.",
