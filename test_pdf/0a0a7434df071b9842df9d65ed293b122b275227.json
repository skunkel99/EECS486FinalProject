            "text": "Aims SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus which is part of the \u00df-coronavirus family (like SARS 2002 and MERS 2012). The high prevalence of hospitalization and mortality, in addition to the lack of vaccines and therapeutics, forces scientists and clinicians around the world to evaluate new therapeutic options. One strategy is the repositioning of already known drugs, which were approved drugs for other indications. Subject and method SARS-CoV-2 entry inhibitors, RNA polymerase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors seem to be valuable targets of research. At the beginning of the pandemic, the ClinicalTrials.gov webpage listed n=479 clinical trials related to the antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 (01.04.2020, \"SARS-CoV-2,\" \"COVID-19,\" \"antivirals,\" \"therapy\"), of which n=376 are still accessible online in January 2021 (10.01.2021). Taking into account further studies not listed in the CTG webpage, this narrative review appraises HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of COVID-19. Results Lopinavir/ritonavir, darunavir/cobicistat, remdesivir, tenofovir-disoproxilfumarate, favipriravir, and sofosbuvir are evaluated in clinical studies worldwide. Study designs show a high variability and results often are contradictory. Remdesivir is the drug, which is deployed in nearly 70% of the reviewed clinical trials, followed by lopinavir/ritonavir, favipiravir, ribavirine, and sofosbuvir. Discussion This review discusses the pharmacological/clinical background and questions the rationale and study design of clinical trials with already approved HIV protease inhibitors and nucleos(t)ide RNA polymerase inhibitors which are repositioned during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic worldwide. Proposals are made for future study design and drug repositioning of approved antiretroviral compounds.",

Sofosbuvir is a uridineanalog, remdesivir is an adenosine-analog and tenofovirdisoproxilfumarate is a thymidine-analog. Most of the chainterminating drugs are nucleoside-analogs missing a functional 3'OH-group (e.g., tenofovir, aciclovir or azidothymidin). Sofosbuvir is an exemption, because it is modified at the 2'OH-group for better antiviral activity against HCV. All of these can cause a premature chain termination by steric inhibition of the viral polymerase [10, 11] . Of these, ribavirin showed the highest binding energy to RNA polymerase (7.8 ckal/mol), but is followed by remdesivir (7.6), sofosbuvir (7.5), galidesvir (7.0), and tenofovir-DF (6.9) [10] .",

Preliminary results of this study indicate that hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 who received remdesivir had a 31% faster time to recovery than those who received placebo (p<0.001). Specifically, the median time to recovery was 11 days for patients treated with remdesivir compared with 15 days for those who received placebo.

The investigators propose a multicenter, openlabel, phase 2B/3 randomized trial of a 7-day treatment with TDF/FTC (2 tablets on day 1, then 1 tablet/day for 6 days) according to the dosage used in pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV. This study is ought to include 60 outpatients (phase 2B) and 120 additional outpatients (phase III) who are diagnosed with SARS-CoV2-positive and have no contraindication to TDF/FTC, without criteria for hospitalization. The primary endpoint of the phase 2B is the SARS-CoV2 antiviral efficacy, quantified by RT-PCR nasopharyngeal sample CT-value increase on day 4 compared to baseline. The primary endpoint of phase 3 will be the rate of noncontagious RT-PCR on day 4 from a nasopharyngeal sample. Secondary endpoints will be tolerance, symptoms resolution, percentage of hospitalization, and the rate of non-contagious RT-PCR on day 7 from a nasopharyngeal sample. This is one of the first studies evaluating an antiviral treatment of SARS-CoV-2 in an outpatient setting, something the ambulatory sector of especially general practitioners are waiting for, since they are currently treating over 90% of all COVID-19 cases.",

Asymptomatic cases may have been missed and [26, 34, [36] [37] [38] data were partially incomplete, such as information about the onset, duration, and intensity of symptoms [53] ; the plasma concentrations of TDF; or HIV-protease inhibitors, which might influence the efficacy of treatment against COVID-19. Furthermore, bacterial coinfections which were reported from a study in the USA [56] were a major reason for mortality in hospitalized patients with HIV and COVID-19. One study even reported a smaller proportion of patients with HIV and COVID-19 compared to the entire hospitalized population due to COVID-19 [57] . However, the data from NEAT indicate n=903 cases of reported HIV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection in Europe until January 25, 2021, with a high rate of hospitalizations (n=374) and deaths (n=68, https://neat-id.knack.com/neat-id-COVID-19# home/). Taken the number of 85279 patients being treated in the reporting sites with an incidence of 1.06%, this corresponds to an incidence of 0.024% in the entire population of people living with HIV and AIDs in Europe (https://www.who.int/hiv/data/ en/), the incidence of SARS-CoV-2-positive tested subjects in Europe in the entire population is 0.4%.
