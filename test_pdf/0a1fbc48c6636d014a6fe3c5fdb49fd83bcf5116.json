We used data from the UK Biobank to assess the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with various anthropometric measures in women and men. To put these results in context, we also compared these estimates with those for mortality from influenza/pneumonia and coronary heart disease (CHD). The analyses included 502,493 individuals (54% women), of whom 410 (36% women) died of COVID-19, 549 (36% women) died of influenza/pneumonia, and 3355 (19% women) died of CHD. A higher BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waistto-height ratio were each associated with a greater risk of death from COVID-19, influenza/pneumonia, and CHD in both sexes, with the exception of the association between higher BMI and the risk of influenza/pneumonia death in men. A higher BMI was associated with a stronger risk of COVID-19 mortality in women than men; the women-to-men ratio of hazard ratios was 1.20 (95% confidence interval: 1.00; 1.43). This study demonstrates the role of obesity in COVID-19 mortality and shows that the relative effects of a higher BMI on COVID-19 mortality may be stronger in women than men.",

We thus assessed the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with various anthropometric measures in women and men in the UK Biobank.

Influenza and pneumonia were taken together to avoid unreliable estimation due to small numbers. Confidence intervals were estimated using floating absolute risks. 6 Adjustments were made for age, smoking status (never/ex/current), socioeconomic status (determined using the Townsend index of area deprivation), ethnicity (white or not). Interactions between each variable and sex were added to the model, so as to obtain the women-to-men ratio of HRs (RHRs) for each risk factor. 7 Penalised smoothing splines were used to examine the shape of associations between BMI and the study endpoints. In secondary analyses, we additionally adjusted for diabetes. We also stratified our analyses on COVID-19 mortality for ethnicity because a previous UK Biobank analysis suggested that the association between BMI and the risk of testing positive for COVID-19 may vary by ethnicity. 8 Analyses used R version 3.3.0.",

The findings for COVID-19 are in agreement with previous studies that highlighted the role of obesity in COVID-19 severity and mortality, although these did not investigate the sex-specific associations. 2, 3 They also add to the findings of previous studies in the UK Biobank that showed that both BMI and waist circumference were associated with an increased chance of testing positive for COVID-19, especially among people from non-White origin. 8 We show that the associations between higher BMI, and of obesity compared to healthy weight, with death from COVID-19 and death from influenza or pneumonia, were each about 20% greater in women than men. Our analyses also suggest that the risk of COVID-19 mortality associated with obesity may be particularly strong among women from non-White origin, although the number of individuals from non-White origin was relatively limited. In agreement with our prior meta-analysis, 4 there was no sex difference in the effects of adiposity on death from CHD. By and large, results were similar for the other three measures of adiposity considered. We are unable to explain the exception to this general agreement in that we found a higher effect on COVID-19 mortality of waist-to-hip ratio in men than women; this requires further study. Otherwise, given that the association between BMI and COVID-19 mortality was stronger, not weaker, in women than men, the greater risk of death from COVID-19 in men is unlikely to be due to a greater relative impact of obesity to death from COVID-19 in men. Although our analyses relied on a single measurements of obesity markers at study baseline, we anticipate that the impact of any changes in obesity levels during follow-up and the risk of COVID-19 would be similar for women and men.",
