            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) pandemic has caused sudden changes in lifestyle. Several data regarding the effects of the COVID-19 state of emergency or lockdown on physical activity levels have been presented worldwide. 1, 2 For instance, a worldwide decrease in step counts has been reported post-COVID- 19 . 3 Countries that implemented lockdowns, such as the UK and France, have had relatively high COVID-19 infection rates and showed rapidly decreasing step counts. In contrast, although countries that did not implement lockdowns, such as Japan and Taiwan, have had relatively low COVID-19 infection rates, overall step counts have decreased in June 2020. These direct and indirect effects might be strong in older adults. Among Japanese older adults aged \u226565 years, total physical activity time per week decreased by 65 min (\u221226.5%) from January to April 2020. 4 Physical activity in older adults has great impacts on future health conditions. It decreases mortality, delays the onset of dementia, prevents frailty and leads to improved self-rated health. [5] [6] [7] [8] In older adults, good exercise habits could be especially important for decreasing the risk of disability onset and lowering mortality. 9 Lifestyle before the COVID-19 pandemic and lifestyle changes during the state of emergency might affect perceived health status, which usually negatively affects future health conditions among older adults. 10 In particular, old-old adults will be easily affected by activity limitations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Crosssectional and longitudinal associations between older adults' selfrated health (e.g. perceptions of physical and cognitive health status) and corresponding objective functions have been reported. 11, 12 In addition, activities including physical exercise and cognitive stimulation (e.g. using a computer) seem to determine perceived positive fitness changes in older adults. 13 Older adults with advancing age might have a greater risk of perceived poor health status on adverse events. Thus, changes in perceived physical and cognitive fitness during the COVID-19 pandemic could implicate future health status among old-old adults.",

Since the first case of infection was confirmed in Hokkaido on 28 January 2020, the infection has widely spread in the area. On 28 February 2020, the governor of Hokkaido declared a state of emergency to control the spread of the infection and avoid a health system collapse. The state of emergency continued until 19 March, requesting that people refrain from going out on weekends, and that they avoid crowded places, close-range conversations and poorly ventilated spaces when going out. The present study was carried out with the approval of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University (No. 200065).

Several studies showed that physical activity (especially exercise habits) was related to mental health in older adults. 21 Several mechanisms manifesting at psychological (e.g. mood, feelings of mastery, self-efficacy) and neurophysiological (e.g. hippocampal neurogenesis, hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis regulation) levels would contribute to mental health, such as by reducing depression and anxiety. 22 A recent study showed that PA levels were related to mental health, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety, in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. 23 In particular, older adults who regularly engaged in vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous PA meeting the World Health Organization's global recommendations for health during the quarantine reported lower depressive symptoms. 23 The intensity and frequency of exercise and physical activity could be important factors that influence health. Moderate-intensity physical activity is recommended to improve or maintain physical and mental health among older adults, 24 but effects on physical and mental health from light-intensity physical activity have also been reported in older adults. 25 In the current study, measurements of physical activity levels and continued exercise habits could be lacking. In addition, the intensity and frequency of exercise were unclear. An adequate instrument (e.g. the International Physical Activity Questionnaire) should be considered in future studies.",

COVID-19 state-of-emergency data differ by region, and the effects might differ depending on the epidemic situation. This study was carried out in a specific city located in Hokkaido, Japan. The COVID-19 pandemic is without precedent worldwide, and the situation changes day-by-day. In such a socially disorienting situation, self-reported answers might differ depending on the time of data collection. Additionally, the study sample was not randomly selected. Although participants with dementia, Parkinson's disease and a history of stroke were excluded, additional exclusionary criteria might be required, such as a history of diabetes, and cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric diseases. There was a relatively high response rate (79.9%); however, non-responders (n = 223; mean age 84.0 AE 4.4 years) were older than responders (mean age 83.3 AE 4.4 years; P = 0.020). There was no significant difference in the proportion of women between responders (55.7%) and non-responders (60.5%; P = 0.191). In addition, the current study sample included old-old adults who had participated in a health check program in 2018, but the characteristics of participants versus non-participants in the 2018 health checkup were not compared. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize the current findings to other areas and situations. Finally, causal relationships should be reconsidered, as this was a transversal study.",
