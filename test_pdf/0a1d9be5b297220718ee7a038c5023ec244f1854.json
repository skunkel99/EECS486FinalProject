We reviewed several studies conducted worldwide and discussing many 29 different methodological approaches aimed at investigating causality associations. Results: Our 30 paper reviewed the most recent empirical researches documenting the existence of a huge evidence 31 produced worldwide concerning the role played by air pollution on health in general and on 32 COVID-19 outcomes in particular. These results support both research hypotheses, i.e. long-term 33 exposure effects and short-term consequences (including the hypothesis of particulate matter 34 acting as viral \"carrier\") according to the two schools of thought, respectively. Conclusions: The 35 link between air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes is strong and robust as resulting from many 36 different research methodologies. Policy implications should be drawn from a \"rational\" 37 assessment of these findings as \"not taking any action\" represents an action itself. 38 39 40 41 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

This 288 simulated counterfactual lockdown is highly significant in reducing negative adverse 289 outcomes and more so in provinces with poorer quality of air. Among robustness checks, the 290 authors smooth daily into weekly data, remove outlier provinces and use as alternative 291 dependent variable the estimated reproduction rate (R 0 ) of the virus.

This phenomenon may 183 eventually lead to deceases for other causes. Second, patients with other serious health 184 emergencies (e.g. strokes, heart attacks) may delay access to hospital because they fear to be 185 infected at hospital by COVID-19. Third, the sharp reduction of traffic during lockdown 186 periods reduces deaths like road or workplace fatalities, especially in big cities.

An obvious caveat of this decomposition is 337 that the time varying component may proxy for both the carrier and the short term effect of 338 PM variation on lung inflammation. The issue remains open to debate and to further research. 339 The quality of natural capital is obviously a strong antidote against air pollution. Italy 340 represents an interesting case study because, according to data from the Ministry of the 341 Environment and Protection of Land and Sea processed by Ancitel, in 2020 there were 2,073 342 municipalities (around 25% of all municipalities) within protected natural areas. These are 343 areas located within national, regional, provincial or local parks, natural reserves and sea 344 natural areas. Around a quarter of municipalities (502) are located in natural parks, while 345 almost half share at least 45% of their surface area with parks, reserves or the so called 346 Environmental Economic Zone (EEZ). EEZ are areas defined in 2019 by a decree-law and 347 enjoy special economic support to preserve their natural resources. If we consider average 348 data from the last three years until end May 2020 (thereby including the first wave of the 349 pandemic), we find that park municipalities have on average 4 \u03bcg/m 3 less of PM2.5and PM10 350 and around one third of NO2. Becchetti et al. [26] calculate that, if we consider prudential 351 estimates from average data from epidemiological findings, people living in \"park 352 municipalities\" have around 8-10% lower mortality rate for this combined effect. Similarly, 353 Becchetti et al. [27] find that better air quality reduced incidence of COVID-19 contagions 354 and deaths in park municipalities during the first pandemic wave after controlling for all 5. Conclusions and policy implications 359 A number of researches in the few months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic have 360 produced robust evidence on the association between air pollution and COVID-19 adverse 361 outcomes (contagions and deaths). The set of methodologies adopted by the different 362 contributions are extremely rich and articulated. The contemporary emergence of significant 363 results from different researchers located worldwide provides evidence in favor of the 364 hypothesis of causation. 365",
