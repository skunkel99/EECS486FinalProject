Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 1400 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 as well as other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. It contains relevant metadata including evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Results: On 5 th August 2020, CoV-AbDab referenced sequence information on 1402 anti-coronavirus antibodies and nanobodies, spanning 66 papers and 21 patents. Of these, 1131 bind to SARS-CoV-2.",

(2020) ; Yuan et al. (2020) ; Robbiani et al. (2020) ). This is possible because many of the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 spike protein domains, including the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD), share high sequence and structural similarity (Tay et al. (2020) ). Other SARS-CoV-2 surface proteins also display high sequence similarity to more distantly related betacoronaviruses, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Therefore, molecular knowledge of any antibody able to bind a betacoronavirus antigen could be relevant in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

As an indication, 1,134 SARS-CoV-2 preprints were uploaded to BioRxiv and MedRxiv between January-March 2020, while 3,462 were uploaded in April and May. We have therefore built CoV-AbDab, a database that documents molecular information (i.e. sequence and structure) and metadata on all preprinted, published, and patented anti-coronavirus antibodies. It will save valuable time in the fight against COVID-19 and act as a central hub to consolidate knowledge and coordinate efforts to identify novel antibodies that neutralise SARS-CoV-2. Researchers can use CoV-AbDab to yield new insights, including deriving crucial sequence/structural patterns that distinguish neutralising from nonneutralising SARS-CoV-2 binders (Iwasaki and Yang (2020) ), or deducing independent neutralising epitopes exploitable by combination therapies (Hansen et al. (2020) ).",
