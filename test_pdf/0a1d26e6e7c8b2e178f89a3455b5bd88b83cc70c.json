High bit-score matches to human HDV were obtained after comparing de novo assembled sequences with a viral reference library (18) . Based on mapping against a reference alignment of all known HDV genotypes, we compiled HDV-related sequences covering the whole deltavirus genome from two individual animals. After aligning these initial genome assemblies with HDV reference genotypes, we designed an RT-PCR assay targeting a fragment in the coding region of the rodent deltavirus antigen (RDeAg). The assay was applied to pooled blood samples from 763 P. semispinosus individuals. Resolution of positive-testing pools resulted in 30 positive individuals (overall detection rate 3.9%; 95% CI 2.6 to 5.3%). Only adult animals were found positive. In addition to P. semispinosus, we examined blood samples from individuals (n = 183) from 11 other rodent and marsupial species.

Genome circularity was further confirmed by mapping RNA-seq reads from the respective samples to the initial amplicon sequences, resulting in assemblies with protruding ends that are identical, matching both ends of the amplicon, and therefore derived from circular templates. Ten full circular RDeV genomes and 10 partial genome assemblies were subsequently obtained from the 30 initially RNA-positive samples by mapping reads from individual RNA-seq datasets.

One of these animals tested RDeV RNA-positive in all available organs (liver, kidney, lung, heart, and small intestine), but its organ-specific RNA concentrations did not suggest specific virus replication in the liver (SI Appendix, Table S4 ). Also, a commercial HDV antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that we found to cross-detect with RDeV did not identify organ-specific protein expression in the liver, lung, small intestine, heart, or kidney of this animal (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A ). To further understand potential virus excretion, fecal samples from 822 individuals were tested by RT-PCR, 10 of which were positive for RDeV RNA (the numbers of individuals tested for each type of material are summarized in SI Appendix, Table S5 ).

A 19-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension differentiates the S-HDAg (195 codons) from the L-HDAg (214 codons) in human HDV. This extension is the result of antigenomic editing by cellular adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) at a site corresponding to the amber stop codon in the S-HDAg ORF of the circular antigenomic HDV RNA, edited from a UAG to a UIG codon. Following HDV RNA replication, the UIG codon is converted into a tryptophan codon (UGG) (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 ) during subsequent HDV messenger RNA (mRNA) synthesis, allowing expression of the L-HDAg (20) . Interestingly, a 19-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension is present in RDeV, though different in 15 of the 19 amino acids. To investigate potential RDeV large antigen (L-RDeAg) expression, the full RDeV genome was cloned as a tandem head-to-tail fusion construct in genomic (minus-strand) orientation downstream of a CMV promoter (see the construct map in SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ) and transfected into HuH7 cells.

Overall, we found 4 out of 30 RDeV RNA-positive rodents in which hepacivirus was not detected by the tests initially applied (SI Appendix, Table S6 ). To exclude having missed hepacivirus detection, we applied RT-PCR assays specifically designed for the E1, NS3, and NS5B genes of P. semispinosus hepacivirus to those samples. All four animals were confirmed to be hepacivirus RNA-negative by these assays as well as by RNAseq read mapping against P. semispinosus hepacivirus. Statistical analysis of the degree of dependency between deltavirus and hepacivirus infection in individuals was conducted, providing no support for a dependency between the two infections (SI Appendix, Table S6 ; \u03c7 2 test, P = 0.24). Also, analyses of sampling sitespecific deltavirus and hepacivirus detection rates (SI Appendix, , as well as an intact dimer of the RDeV genome (both panels).

To determine whether RDeV causes an immune reaction in P. semispinosus, serum samples were subjected to an indirect immunofluorescence assay. L-RDeAg was cloned and transiently expressed in Vero B4 cells, as described (23) . To exclude RNA degradation in the case of antibody-positive samples for which RDeV RNA was not detected, we applied a real-time RT-PCR assay to detect RNA transcripts of a host housekeeping gene (TATA-binding protein) (SI Appendix, Table  S8 ). The 20 positive sera were additionally tested at 1:1,000 dilution, testing positive in 5 cases. Western blots of these sera against expressed S-RDeAg confirmed the specificity of serum antibodies (Fig. 2E) . The average RDeV RNA concentration in all anti-RDeAg-positive sera was 262,400 RNA copies per microliter of blood. The average RDeV RNA concentration in only those samples that tested antibody-positive up to a dilution of 1:1,000 was 8,500 RNA copies per microliter of blood (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C ). These concentrations were significantly different (P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test), which suggests that an adaptive immune response can potentially limit or eliminate viral replication. Elimination is also suggested by the occurrence of three anti-RDeAg antibody-positive but RDeV RNA-negative animals.",

The study area in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument consists of islands and peninsulas with different densities of populations of P. semispinosus, a generalist species that can adapt to environmental changes (24) and thus (relatively) competitively benefit from anthropogenic habitat disturbance. We have previously noted a positive correlation between site-specific P. semispinosus population density and the detection rate of hepacivirus infection (SI Appendix, Table  S7 ) (17) . For rodent deltavirus, a different site-specific distribution was observed (SI Appendix, Table S7 ). Highest detection rates were identified in continuous forest sites that have largely preserved the primordial habitat composition that existed before the flooding of the Gat\u00fan Lake area during the construction of the Panama Canal. Lower detection rates were found on forested islands, and minimal rates in forest fragments surrounded by agriculture. To identify environmental factors that might correlate with rodent deltavirus transmission, host-and habitat-specific properties were examined under two different logistic regression models (SI Appendix, Table  S9 ). RDeV infection was found to be positively correlated with male sex and reproductive activity, as well as with inhabiting continuous forest sites with undisturbed habitat. In addition to the variables shown in SI Appendix, Table S9 , other habitat-specific factors such as population density, canopy height and coverage, and understory density did not add explanatory power to the analysis. The inclusion of site-specific data on mosquito diversity narrowed the sample size to n = 686 individuals for sampling sites where these data were available. There was no detectable correlation between mosquito diversity and RDeV detection rate.",

            "text": "The present results enhance our understanding of the evolution of hepatitis delta virus, a satellite virus to HBV and until recently the only human RNA virus with no known counterpart in other animals. The first question that must follow the discovery of novel deltavirus-like sequences in rodent, reptile (15) , and putatively avian (14) and other vertebrate and invertebrate hosts (16) is whether these represent transmissible viruses as opposed to, for example, endogenous viral elements. Hetzel et al. (15) demonstrated protein expression in organs of those snakes in which viral sequences were detected, and Szirovicza et al. (25) showed that snake deltavirus can replicate in several cell lines. Our reverse genetic and clonal expansion experiments now prove the existence of mammalian nonhuman deltavirus genomes as self-replicating viral entities, in which genomic replication involves an internal initiation of replication. Moreover, correlations of serology and virus detection in a natural animal population of considerable size demonstrate that rodent deltavirus infection is acquired during the course of life and is likely to be cleared by an active immune response. Previous observations on the snake deltavirus corroborate this infection pattern, showing that although snake deltavirus infection was found in both maternal and offspring boas (15) , not all offspring were infected, and snakes with no kinship to the mating pairs exhibited both the presence and absence of the virus. Horizontal transmission seems likely in both rodent and reptile deltaviruses. The significantly lower detection rate of viral RNA in stool samples compared with blood suggest blood-borne rather than fecal-oral transmission. The observed predominant infection of adult males is compatible with transmission through competitive behavior. The novel deltaviruses associated with diverse hosts warrant considerations regarding evolutionary origins. Phylogeny suggests that fish-and amphibian-associated viruses are most distant from other known deltaviruses, while snake and rodent viruses are significantly closer to the HDV common ancestor. Considering the relationship of these hosts, the tree topology seems to disfavor Fig. 3 . Maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on a full-genome alignment of HDV representatives from the eight different genotype groups and RDeV, SDeV, duck-associated DeV, newt DeV, toad DeV, fish DeV, and termite DeV. The phylogenetic inference was done using RAxML-NG version 0.7.0 BETA (19) . Asterisks indicate bootstrap support >80 and tree tips show GenBank accession numbers. The tree is rooted to the branch leading to the nonhuman DeVs. Distribution of evolutionary distances (branch lengths, extracted from 1,000 bootstraps) for all nonhuman DeVs relative to the common ancestor of HDV (arrow on tree) is shown in the boxplots. The boxplots show median, interquartile range, Tukey's minimum and maximum (whiskers), and extreme outlier values (dotted).",

Besides, the duck-associated virus was not detected in an internal organ but in cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs, leaving open the possibility of contamination from alimentary sources (14) . The phylogenetic branch pattern supports previous work on human HDV phylogeny, suggesting that HDV genotype 3 stems from the oldest common ancestor of human HDV genotypes (26) . As this ancestor is more closely related to the rodent virus than to any of the nonmammalian deltaviruses, this would be compatible with the hypothesis that human and rodent deltaviruses have codiverged with mammalian lineages. Deltaviruses in other mammals may remain to be discovered, but equally may now be extinct. A hypothesis of codivergence would be corroborated by the discovery of at least one more mammalian virus whose phylogenetic position reflects that of its host in relation to humans and rodents. The clustering of rodent and snake viruses might then be interpreted as a sign of cross-species acquisition from mammals. It is noteworthy that the parental boas carrying the snake deltavirus stemmed from Panama, like the rodents studied here (15) . Human HDV genotype 3 is also found in South and Middle America, but this alone should not be taken as support to claim cross-host transmission.",

Neither HBV DNA nor anti-HBc antibodies were detected in any animals infected with the deltavirus. In all other deltavirus studies, no sequences of coinfecting hepadnaviruses were found in transcriptome data.

Despite a high hepacivirus prevalence in the studied rodents [ca. 80% (17)], we found four deltavirus RNApositive individuals lacking a hepacivirus coinfection. Human HDV has been found to produce infectious particles in vitro with the help of an envelope protein from hepatitis C virus, with the required presence of an L-HDAg farnesylation motif (22) . Given the absence of this motif in the rodent delta antigen and the lack of a hepacivirus coinfection in some individuals carrying deltavirus RNA, we do not consider deltavirus infection to depend on hepacivirus infection in these rodents. In addition, we screened individual RNA-seq datasets from 120 animals and did not identify any other infectious viral agent in any deltavirus RNA-positive P. semispinosus. There are multiple alternatives that may have resulted in rodent deltavirus transmission. One possibility is the presence of a currently unknown virus, bacterium, or integrated sequence that provides an envelope protein to rodent deltavirus. Furthermore, recent advances in cellular cross-communication have revealed the exchange of extracellular vesicles containing mRNA, circRNA, and other noncoding RNA molecules (29) . It should be investigated whether rodent deltavirus might employ such pathways for transmission.",

While the larger band might correspond to a larger protein variant, expression of an actual L-SDeAg was not confirmed by specific anti-L-SDeAg immunoblots, analyses of RNA editing, or experimental studies of gene expression. The present data, based on all these approaches, show that the related rodent virus does not express a large delta antigen, suggesting that the use of L-HDAg may have evolved only in connection with the utilization of the HBV envelope. In this scenario, the encounter with hepadnaviruses may have selected for viral variants with a farnesylation signal in an L-HDAg tail that is expressed by an initially low-level editing activity or stop codon readthrough, allowing these viruses to exploit a novel transmission opportunity by acquisition of an HBV envelope. The sequence information from the present study can now be used in directed searches for deltaviruses in other mammalian species, even in the absence of HBV infection.",

            "text": "Alternative hypotheses of HDV origin have suggested either a viroid origin (perhaps via an insect vector) or derivation from a host DIPA gene (reviewed in ref. 11). A viroid origin is supported by the structural similarity of the HDV ribozyme to plant viroid ribozymes, the genome circularity of both HDV and viroids, and the interaction with common cellular proteins (30) . Derivation from the human genome has been suggested based on the incomplete set of genes essential for replication, the occurrence of HDV-like ribozyme elements in the human genome (31) , and the interaction of HDV with a human-derived protein (DIPA) (32) . The deltavirus findings do not increase or decrease support for the viroid origin hypothesis but force us to consider the DIPA hypothesis from a wider perspective. The rodent deltavirus ORF shows 30% nucleotide and 22% amino acid identity when compared with the DIPA ORF in mice and rats, at which levels similarity due to chance must be considered as a likely explanation (33) . In addition to these caveats, the present results suggest that other mammalian deltaviruses existed before the origin of human HDV, and that precursors to these mammalian viruses existed in other vertebrates (14) (15) (16) . Alternate scenarios, specifically the derivation of nonhuman deltaviruses from human HDV precursors, seem unlikely, considering the genetic distances between these viruses, the relatively short time span available for the evolution of such diversity in the case of a human origin, and the requirement that the human virus infect several nonhuman hosts. It appears instead that deltavirus originated as an exogenous infectious agent that established acute infection in mammals. The present study provides a basis for the evolution of HDV, confirming the general understanding that RNA virus diversity evolved along the major evolutionary lineages of their hosts (34) .",
