            "text": "Background Maternity care in hospitals in the Republic of Ireland is funded by a hybrid of public finance and private health insurance. Aims The aim of this longitudinal observational study was to investigate the annual trends in maternity care from 2009 to 2017 during and after the Great Economic Recession. Methods All women who delivered a singleton baby weighing \u2265 500 g during the 9 years (2009-2017) were included. Detailed clinical and sociodemographic details were computerised at the first antenatal visit by a trained midwife. Women who delivered their first baby during the study were analysed longitudinally if they delivered again during the 9 years. Results The mean age of the 73,266 women was 31.3 \u00b1 5.6 years, 40.1% were nulliparas, and 70.3% were Irish-born. Overall, 75.2% opted for the public, 10.8% for the semi-private, and 14.0% for the private package of maternity care. Over the 9 years, the number of women choosing private and semi-private care decreased by 21.6% and 35.3%, respectively, whereas the number of women using public care increased by 12.3%. Most women opted for the same package of care in subsequent pregnancies. Conclusions Ireland's recent economic recession was accompanied by an overall decrease in the number of women choosing private maternity care after 2009. Furthermore, economic recovery with increasing female employment after 2012 was not associated with a recovery in demand for private care. These findings have important implications for healthcare policies and for the future organisation and funding of our maternity services.",

As pregnancy and delivery rates are beyond the control of the health services, funding shortages cannot be solved by methods applicable for other services, for example, waiting lists for elective surgery. As there are no private maternity hospitals left in Ireland, removing private maternity practice from public hospitals as proposed by Sl\u00e1intecare also poses challenges [12] .

The abolition of the private and semi-private packages of care in public hospitals would deny women who have been paying PHI, perhaps for many years, of choice. It is notable in our study that the continuity of care packages was maintained from one pregnancy to the next. Younger women who pay PHI are generally healthy, and the national policy of community rating means that younger subscribers to PHI subsidise older subscribers [6] . A recent Irish study has shown decreasing percentages of 'very healthy' and 'healthy' women with PHI coverage between 2009 and 2017 [3] .
