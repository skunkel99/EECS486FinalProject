Data were analysed thematically. Findings: Participants were aware of the mechanism of transmission of covid-19 and took steps to mitigate risk of transmission including, observing a range of hygiene practices and following social distancing guidance. Increased risk of covid-19 for BAME populations was explained largely in terms of exposure to the virus due to the types of employment people from BAME populations are employed in. Limitations both within the working environment and more generally in public spaces, was identified as problematic for effective social distancing. The closure of mosques sent out a strong message about the seriousness of the virus and religious teachings reinforced hygiene and social distancing guidelines.",

Growing evidence shows that covid-19 does not affect all members of the population equally, with those living in urban areas and in more deprived areas being disproportionately affected [1] . Evidence also shows that people from Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds are being harder hit [1, 2] . In the UK~19% of hospital deaths have been among BAME groups and people from BAME groups account for 35% of critical care unit patients in England [3, 4] . These differences in mortality from covid-19 between groups in society are increasingly being explained in terms of differences in demographic, geographic and socio-economic factors [5] . These highlight stark and continuing health inequalities experienced by disadvantaged [6] and specifically BAME populations [4, 6] . BAME groups often experience poorer socioeconomic circumstances including, living in more deprived neighbourhoods with overcrowded and multigenerational households, employment in essential occupations and reliance on public transport [7] [8] [9] . They also experience higher levels of comorbidities and differential access to appropriate and adequate healthcare services [7, 8] . These circumstances compound effects of covid-19 and its transmission across different BAME groups.",

These included 'stay at home' message (with the advisement to leave home for essential reasons only), a 2 m distance to be maintained between individuals from separate households (wherever possible) and the requirement to self-isolate away from others within the household if experiencing typical symptoms of the virus [10, 11] . On the 11th of May 2020 the message changed to 'stay alert' with some restrictions being relaxed [12, 13] . This study took place during this initial lockdown period that commenced on the 23rd March during the 'stay at home' period of restrictions and continued on through the subsequent more relaxed 'stay alert' restrictions imposed on the 11th of May, but was completed before the reintroduction of restrictions locally or nationally as infection rates rose later in the year.",

This differential capacity within populations is also a likely factor in the differential mortality rates between populations and areas. Compliance and response to local lockdown measures may vary across population groups; with people from different ethnic backgrounds varying in behaviours, comorbidities and immune profiles, and consequently their risk of infection and its consequences [7] . The Muslim population makes up the second largest religious group in the UK [2] . There are growing concerns that the Muslim community in the UK are particularly vulnerable to covid-19 [1, 2, 14] . Reports indicate that the highest age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) of deaths involving covid-19 were within the Muslim group, with 198.9 deaths per 100,000 males and 98.2 deaths per 100,000 females within the period 2-March to 15-May 2020 [15] . The Muslim community in the UK often come from multi-generational households, have comorbidities and a relatively higher proportion live in areas of deprivation [1, 2] . Such conditions can increase the risk of covid-19 infection and create barriers to social distancing or effective self-isolation.",

There are perhaps two likely explanations for this difference, first, in our sample, some participants perceived themselves to be at greater risk of contracting the virus because of their exposure to it through their working role. A recent study of health compliance in the context of covid-19 found that general anxiety/fear of covid-19 was predictive of social distancing and hygiene behaviours [28] . Economic need was also identified as a driving force leading to greater exposure to the virus due to low wages, self-employment in occupations where working from home was not an option and people were ineligibility for financial support. A review of covid-19 impact within BAME groups, highlighted the impact of these types of long-standing structural inequalities and the need for urgent action to address these [29] .",

They suggested that if compliance is influenced by instrumental factors (self-interest), then in the context of covid-19, one might expect that those at increased risk from the virus would be motivated to comply with restrictions, whilst the concept of risk would have little influence on those within lower risk groups. Our findings would seem to support such a proposition, participants in our study perceived those not adhering to social distancing rules to not be taking the virus seriously, as evidenced by their failure to maintain social distancing recommendation in public places, even when asked to do so. Murphy et al., have explored the relationship between demographic, instrumental and normative factors, and compliance with covid-19 social distancing restrictions and concluded that Australians were motivated to comply not because of concerns for themselves or others but instead, because of a sense of duty to support authorities [30] . A number of studies have reported a link between perceptions of risk and compliance with health protection behaviours during times of pandemics. A 2010 review of papers focusing on determinants of protective behaviours during pandemics [31] , found that greater perceived susceptibility to disease and perceived severity of disease was associated with adoption of health behaviours during pandemic. A telephone survey in Italy exploring the relationship between a number of variables (including risk perception) and compliance with recommendations during the H1N1 pandemic also found that perceptions about the severity of illness and risk of catch the virus was associated with compliance with some recommended behaviours [32] . More recent covid-19 studies of compliance offer conflicting findings concerning the influence of perceived risk to self on health protection behaviours. A USA study, reported that feelings of personal risk of contracting covid-19 influenced people's tendency to engage with hand-washing and social distancing measures but perceived risk of severity of the virus did not [27] . An international questionnaire study of beliefs and attitudes about covid-19, found that perceiving oneself as vulnerable to covid-19, perceived severity of catching covid-19 and trust in government were less important predictors of taking health protection precautions than the belief that taking health protection measures would be effective in avoiding covid-19 and prioritizing one's health [33] .",

However, following social norms and adhering to centralized rules is contingent on recognition of laws as essential for social order and that compliance must override personal interest [29, 34] . Social expectations or norms that influence adaptive decision-making may come into conflict when certain choices are beneficial for the individual whilst societal rules mandates a different course of action [35] . In our study, provision of information and guidance was noted to be problematic for a variety of reasons, leading some to question the legitimacy of the virus and its seriousness. This point is important, given that inconsistent information from authorities can lead to questioning of information credibility and willingness to quarantine if sick [36] . Mismatches between messages centrally and the actions of members of the local community and prominent figures in government, constituted a confusing array of signs about how people should best respond to mitigate risk. Messages that highlighted minimal risk to the many whilst more severe risk to the relative few, was suggested as a sign to some, that there was no need for them to change their behaviour. Based on previous evidence, such a message would be unlikely to motivate those that perceive themselves to be at minimal risk to adhere to restrictions. Participants acknowledged that conflicting signs could lead some to question the seriousness of the virus and consequently the need to take action to mitigate risk. These types of value-based decisions are particularly tough to determine, and require a complex trade-off between self and other regarding motivations [34] . Adaptive decisions often require integration of information from several sources that are weighted according to their respective reliability [37] . A particular issue with regard to information getting to the community was the loss of usual channels of communication through the mosques. This was problematic not only in getting a message that was understood, but also one that was recognised has having authority within the community. Lack of trust within BAME communities due to mixed messages during covid-19 pandemic has recently been reported [29] . This is problematic given that trust in authorities is important for compliance with health protection behaviours during pandemics [38] and it has been noted previously that faith-based credible information sources such as Muslim Council of Britain that are trusted by local communities are important in conveying public health messages [39] . Recent evidence from a study of compliance with covid-19 measures among youth advocates leveraging trustworthy individuals in the community to disseminate Public Health messages [40] .",

Our findings indicate that whilst adhering to social distancing rules was undoubtedly challenging and particularly so in the context of the month of Ramadan and Eid festival, including not being able to break the fast together in the usual way, most participants noted that these departures from normative practices were wholly acceptable and in line with religious teachings. Evidence suggests that such obligations, including duty to obey authoritative figures are associated with enhanced compliance to covid-19 restrictions and that sense of obligation is instilled at a young age [30, 41] . Our evidence does not indicate, contrary to prejudice claims, that Muslims ignore advice [29] and were congregating in large gatherings as a norm. This can be seen as othering and victim blaming [21] , especially in social and popular media [18, 19] . These behaviours were alleged to explain spikes in BAME communities and areas of the country with higher proportion of BAME populations [20] .",

Also whilst there have been some published studies about compliance in the context of covid-19, these are survey studies.

Despite a variety of routes to engage older community members we were unable to recruit participants older then 65, limiting our data directly from retired and older working community members, although respondents described their perceptions of older community members. We believe this barrier to research participation was at least partly due to language barriers within this age group, and a lack of familiarity with, or trust in, research as a process. Therefore, further research is important to capture the experiences of non-English speakers and older adults. Given that this study was conducted within the early period of the pandemic, there is potential for peoples' experiences and perceptions of risk to have shifted over time.",

Religious beliefs and a strong sense of responsibility were important drivers of behaviour, supporting key government messages about social distancing.
