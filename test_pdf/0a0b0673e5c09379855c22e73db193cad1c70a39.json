To achieve this, our brain transforms skin-based coordinates into a reference frame by integrating visual and proprioceptive cues, a process known as tactile remapping. In the current study, we examine the role of proprioception in the remapping process when information from the more dominant visual modality is withheld. We developed a new visual-to-touch sensory substitution device and asked participants to perform a spatial localization task in three different arm postures that included posture switches between blocks of trials. We observed that in the absence of visual information novel proprioceptive inputs can be overridden after switching postures. This behavior demonstrates effective top-down modulations of proprioception and points to the unequal contribution of different sensory modalities to tactile remapping.",

            "text": "How does body posture influence the way we interpret and perceive the external environment? Our constant physical interaction with the world requires a continuous update of the body's location in external space, its relation to other objects, and its relation to itself (e.g., the relative positions of body-parts in motion). These varied representations of the body form a conscious perception of the external world and play an essential role in action planning. Think for instance of driving a car with a stirring wheel in your hand -sensory information about the wheel gives rise to a coherent perception of its function and leads to a set of possible actions that one can perform with it. First, we access the wheel's physical dimensions through tactile stimulations received on our palms that form an anatomical reference frame. To steer the car, we transfer this information into a different reference frame that integrates the anatomical reference frame with external information fitting the wheel's functional use (e.g. the sidewalk is to right, the opposite lane is to left), in a process known as tactile remapping 1, 2 . The transformation results in the adoption of an allocentric reference frame that is independent of the body, relating objects' dimensions to external anchors, or of an egocentric reference frame, relating objects' positions to one's own body 3, 4 . Tactile stimulations can be remapped into many allocentric or egocentric reference frames with the ultimate selection depending on the actions that precede or follows the sensation 5, 6 , the gravitational dimensions of the external environment [7] [8] [9] [10] , and the general position of the body 2,4,11 .",

To disentangle the contribution of proprioception from other factors, we built a visual-to-tactile Sensory Substitution Device (SSD) 22,23 that transforms 2D grayscale images into tactile stimuli delivered on the inner arm. The fixed device moves together with the arm and thus nullifies the need to actively relocate the stimulations. With this unique setup, we had participants perform a simple spatial localization/orientation task while also switching their arm's posture between trial blocks. We aimed to further investigate the 4 role of posture in tactile remapping by asking how switching postures affect previously acquired references. According to a strictly sensorimotor prediction, after switching postures new proprioceptive cues will gradually integrate with a stored body representation that will produce an adaptation and learning period, characterized by less consistent responses and longer decision times. Results in this direction will suggest that, albeit vision's dominant influence, incoming proprioceptive signals strongly influence the remapping process. An alternative hypothesis is that proprioception is a unique sensory modality, which we are less consciously aware of 24 , and its effect on remapping is weaker than previously assumed. In this case, participants would rapidly adapt to new postures as top-down representations would override incoming bottom-up proprioceptive cues, diverging from a pure sensorimotor contingency description.",

We found that participants' initial selection of reference frames is highly dependent on their posture, and was not anchored to a specific anatomical location on the inner arm, such as the wrist or the elbow. The remapping destination was to another body part, such as the trunk or face, which reflected an egocentric reference frame, or otherwise anchored to the external environment in an allocentric reference reference frame that is centered on the trunk or external by reversing their perception of the vertical axis. In contrast to these predictions, the other half adopted a new reference frame that is based on the anatomy of the inner arm, which is invariant to changes in the arm's posture.",

Participants exhibit a strong consistency in their responses after changing postures while their decision times are unaffected and continue to follow a general learning curve trend (save for the first trial after the switch). Although participants' initial reference frame is trunk/facecentered or external, many of our participants switch to a reference frame that is centered on the anatomy of the inner arm. Moreover, our post-hoc analysis hints that participants who chose the inner arm as a reference may sport shorter decision times, even when considering trials that occurred before the switch. The latter result suggests that differences in decision times between the groups couldn't be specifically linked with a posture switch, but perhaps associated with a more general behavior. The small and uneven number of subjects per group and the lack of differences in the learning rate between them calls for a more direct investigation by future studies.",

            "text": "Considering the weighing scheme model of sensorimotor contingencies 2 in the context of our findings, the ability to select multiple reference frames with little cognitive costs follows an extreme instance where all options are weighed equally. It is possible that while the initial choice of reference frames is implicit, switching posture in the absence of vision forces participants to make an explicit choice. This is further corroborated by the results from the second posture switch, where all participants maintained their previous reference frame affirming an explicit choice. Taken together, our results show that top-down modulation can easily nullify low-order proprioceptive cues when choosing between reference frames, and that previously stored representations can be abstracted from current sensory inputs and spatial tasks. We suggest that the lack of visual inputs is the primary reason for the behavior. Vision is essential in forming body representations and has been widely reported as dominant over competing inputs from other modalities 2, 19, 25, 26 . For example, crossing effects in temporal order judgments are substantially decreased when participants are blindfolded but the same manipulation has little effect on the weighing of different reference frames in congenitally blind adults [27] [28] [29] . Moreover, vision and touch share a combined multisensory object representation, which is formed by inputs from both modalities 30 . Visual cues thus act both as facilitators for body representations but also act as a disturbance to maintaining a stored body representation that was tactually derived. As our participants are blindfolded, vison could not override the changes in proprioceptive signals, revealing the contribution of proprioception to the coordinate transformation process. Proprioception is a unique sensory modality, and though much is known about its physiology, it remains a somewhat esoteric sensory modality. While vision is an exteroceptor identified with a known sensation, proprioception is an interoceptor that, for the most part, is not consciously perceived 24 . It is a perception of the self that results from motor actions taken and initiated by the self, and can thus be predicted. As such, the sensory consequences of arm movement could be anticipated, and they might interfere less with higher body representations. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that top-down modulations can nullify new proprioceptive information during the process of tactile remapping, ultimately confirming that the weight of proprioceptive information during spatial tasks is considerably weaker compared to that of visual information.

In part one (a) participants significantly chose a distal preference in the Flexion condition, a proximal preference in the Extension condition, and did not significantly choose neither in the Neutral condition.

After switching postures (b) participants in both the Flexion and Extension conditions did not show a significant preference for either a proximal or a distal selection. Earlier adaption of reference frames primed participants' remapping after the posture switch.

            "text": "However, the neutral posture could neither prompt a trunk-centered nor an external reference frame as the arm is positioned perpendicularly to the trunk and to the updown coordinates of the room. However, participants' responses were individually consistent, and reference frames were easily adopted even in this ambiguous spatial position. This behavior might be related to the specific body part in use (i.e., a body-part to which we are trained to select a reference frame even in ambiguous spatial conditions), or due to the lack of guiding visual inputs that could cause confusion.The ability to adopt reference frames independent of posture was further corroborated in part 2, where participants switched between opposing postures. According to the sensorimotor contingencies theory, switching postures should facilitate an adaptation period while new sensory information is integrated with stored body representations13,16 . The cognitive cost in adapting to new postures is described as a multisensory integration problem that requires updating stored representations with new sensory information from many modalities. In line with the predictions of this theory, our results show that the selection of reference frames was strongly primed by the previous posture. About half of the group kept a",

Sample sizes were first chosen on the basis of first-level analysis, such that the number of overall trials is sufficient for a normal approximation which allows for a standardized t-test. However, in some cases the number of participants per condition allowed only a non-parametric second-level analysis, and further samples could not be collected due to the coronavirus crisis. No participants or samples were excluded from the study.The experiments were approved by the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) ethics committee, all participants signed an informed consent form and were paid for their participation in the study. The two experiments in this study were performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations set by the IDC institutional ethics committee. The \"Tactile Glove\" -device description 14 The \"Tactile Glove\" is a custom-built Sensory Substitution Device (SSD) that conveys visual information from a 2D image into vibrotactile stimulations. The glove consists of 15 standard 8-millimeter diameter coin vibration motors which are placed in a row on the participant's inner arm, another vibrator on the index finger acts as a precursor. Each actuator is supplied with a five Volt logic and interfaced with a Data Acquisition Module (iUSBDAQ-U120816, HYTEK Automation). An accompanying algorithm (written in C#) down-samples 2D images to a 15-by-25-pixel grayscale image, with white pixels denoting objects (e.g. lines or shapes). The binary image is temporally scanned from left to right, column by column using a sweep-line approach. For each white-colored pixel detected in a column, an actuator simultaneously vibrates on the inner arm. This procedure results in the image's Y-axis represented by the spatial location on the arm, and the X-axis represented by timing (e.g., parts of the image that are heard sooner are positioned more to the left). Each stimulus comprises of a 300ms precursor cue, a short 100ms pause, and another 150ms spent on each column of the image. Participants had no prior familiarity with the device, the algorithm, nor with any other SSD. Stimuli and postures The stimuli consisted of 8 black and white images: four images depicted horizontal lines and another 4 depicted diagonal lines (see Fig. 1b. for some examples of the stimuli). Three postures were used as experimental conditions (Fig. 1a.): a) Arm Extension, with the palm facing outward in full supination; b) Arm Flexion, with participants' elbow leaning on an adjacent table, palm facing toward the face; c) An in-between position, named a Neutral posture, with the arm placed on the table and the palm facing the ceiling. We visually verified throughout the sessions that participants maintain their postures during experimental blocks.",
