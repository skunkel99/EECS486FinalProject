There were no remarkable changes in other organs, including the liver (1120 g), kidneys (left, 140 g; right, 100 g), and spleen (110 g). Microscopically, the epithelial cells of the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles were mostly denuded, with submucosal infl ammatory cell infi ltration, edema, and congestion (Appendix Figure 2 desquamated alveolar epithelial cells, mononuclear cell infiltrates, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the alveolar air spaces (Appendix Figure 2 , panel C), and various degrees of inflammatory cell infiltration and edema in the interstitium. In addition, we observed neutrophil infiltration in the alveolar spaces scattered throughout the lower lobes, suggestive of acute bronchopneumonia (Figure 2 , panels A, C; Appendix Figure 2 , panel D). We noted a limited number of gram-positive cocci in the intracellular and extracellular regions (Appendix Figure 2 , panel E). Vascular congestion was present in several lung sections with prominent fibrin microthrombi in blood vessels of various sizes (Appendix Figure 2 , panel F).

These results indicate a relatively early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which implies that bacterial co-infection may have contributed to an abrupt deterioration of respiratory function in the patient. Bacterial co-infection of the respiratory tract has been well characterized in influenza, with a reported coinfection rate exceeding 30% in hospitalized patients (9, 10) . Co-infection with S. pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus has been linked to excess illness and death (9) . In contrast, recent studies have suggested that bacterial co-infection is relatively uncommon in patients with COVID-19, with a prevalence of 3.5% in patients who were newly admitted to the hospital (11, 12) . However, given the serious and potentially lethal complications resulting from bacterial infections, the possibility of co-infection with other microbial pathogens should be also considered in patients with COVID-19, especially in elderly patients with severe disease, and it is difficult to identify bacterial co-infection on computed tomography images alone after the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (13) .",
