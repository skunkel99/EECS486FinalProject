To study these stylized facts, we estimate a DSGE model with endogenous entry and exit. Business units feature heterogeneous productivity and they shut down if the present value of expected future dividends falls below the current liquidation value. The model provides a better fit than a constant exit rate model with the fluctuations of US business formation. The introduction of the extensive margin amplifies the effects of technology and risk-premium shocks, and reduces the procyclicality of firm-level production. The main sources of variability of the US aggregate fluctuations during the Great Recession are countercyclical technology shocks, persistent adverse risk-premium shocks, and expansionary monetary policy shocks.",

Building on Lewis and Poilly (2012) , Lewis and Stevens (2015) and LaCroce and Rossi (2018) , we consider a sticky-price model with variable number of firms, and extend the analysis to account for the above mentioned stylized facts. 1 Lewis and Poilly (2012) consider the extensive margin in a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to analyze monetary policy and business cycles. In addition, Lewis and Stevens (2015) provide a quantitative exploration of the extensive margin of activity by estimating a DSGE-style model with Bayesian methods. LaCroce and Rossi (2018) include financial frictions and a banking sector with monopolistically competitive retail banks. More recently, Hamano and Zanetti (2018) focus on the effect of product quality and variety due to firm entry for the cyclical properties of inflation and the volatility of business cycle fluctuations. 2 However, as a common feature, these papers assume a constant rate of exit which leaves business formation mostly driven by fluctuations in the rate of entry. The variability in the rate of exit observed in the data is clearly at odds with the constant rate of exit rate formulation.",

            "text": "Hence, the first contribution of our paper on the modelling side is to introduce an intertemporal exit rate decision that takes into account the liquidation value of the firm and expected dividends. Remarkably, while the entry of new firms (or new varieties of consumption goods) has been widely considered in DSGE models, few papers have proposed an analysis of firm exit. 3 Recently, Chugh and Cavallari (2015) , Cavallari (2015) , Zanetti (2017 , 2020 ) , and Rossi (2019) have proposed endogenous exit of firms motivated by reasons different than ours. 4 These attempts, however, turn out to be not satisfactory in addressing the stylized facts in the post-2008 financial crisis period. In Hamano and Zanetti (2017) , for example, the exit decision is based upon the current value of profits and it does not consider any liquidation cost associated with exit. This feature makes the exit decision intratemporal . In another recent paper, Cavallari (2015) considers scrap values, which are time-invariant and firm specific, in the exit decision. Rossi (2019) assumes that the liquidation value is zero. By contrast, we introduce heterogeneity through both firm-specific productivity and a time-varying liquidation value. This formulation has the advantage that we can assess how both the heterogeneity of incumbents and changes in the liquidation value can shape the intertemporal exit decision. 5 In our model, the exit rate depends on the productivity threshold that compares a firm's continuation value with its liquidation value. At the end of the production period, the business unit remains in the industry if the present value of all expected dividends exceeds the liquidation value. 6 In the opposite case, the business unit exits the industry, the production of its variety ends and there is business destruction.",

The extended model performs well on replicating business creation and destruction observed in recent US data. In particular, the posterior estimates generate model simulations that provide a good match on the second-moment statistics of the US entry rates, exit rates and net business formation. In the variance decomposition, the sources of fluctuations for entry and exit are rather different. The entry rate fluctuations are mainly the consequence of demand-side shocks while supply-side shocks, by contrast, have a large impact on the exit rate. Shocks to the entry costs and to the liquidation value are additional sources of US aggregate fluctuations that are not accounted in conventional DSGE models. We find that they jointly explain 13% of the variability of the quarterly rate of growth of US real GDP.",

The important role of technology shocks to explain business cycle fluctuations during this episode has also been documented by Jermann and Quadrini (2012) and Zanetti, 2019 in the context of models without entry and exit. The importance of risk-premium shocks during the Great Recession was also established in Christiano et al. (2014) .

The decline of the entry rate strongly contributes to the fall of the average quarterly business formation as its mean falls from 3.39% to 3.00%. 10 The exit rate also falls, although it does so to a lesser extent from an average of 2.98% in 1993-2006 to 2.83% in the Great Recession.

The extensive margin of aggregate fluctuations (measured by the percent variations in TPE) turns more volatile, more procyclical with respect to real GDP growth (both at the same quarter and with a one-quarter lag), and more persistent after the financial crisis of 2007-08. The standard deviation of TPE growth, its correlation with real GDP growth and its autocorrelation increase substantially between the Great Moderation and the Great Recession. 11 Table 1 also informs on stronger procyclical patterns of US net business formation when considering a one-quarter lag for real GDP growth possibly due to some time-to-build delay.",

As another piece of evidence, the average quarterly rate of growth of real GDP per capita within the whole sample period was 0.38%, whereas TPE growth per capita only grew at a quarterly average of 0.12%. 11 Notably, there was neither inertia nor cyclicality of TPE growth over the period 1993 to 2006 (the sample statistics on cyclical correlation and auctocorrelation are both zero). reflect the time-to-build requirements to create new businesses. Likewise, there are increasing patterns for the volatility and persistence of the exit rate fluctuations, and also a stronger negative comovement between the exit rate and real GDP growth during the Great Recession period. Table 1 reports more substantial changes in the standard deviation, and in the cyclical correlation of the exit rate than of the entry rate. Fig. 1 shows rolling-window statistics obtained from US quarterly data of 48 quarters per sample. There are striking patterns observed as the quarters of the Great Recession enter the sample. Hence, the series of TPE growth increases its volatility, procyclicality and persistence after 1997. Such increasing role of the extensive margin for aggregate fluctuations remains strong as the window rolls over time, with high values for the latest windows. As Fig. 1 displays, the changes in the second-moment statistics of the entry rate seems to be transitory (with peaks observed in the central subsamples between 1998 and 2009). Nevertheless, the exit rate still exhibits increased volatility, countercyclicality and persistence over the last years of the rolling window which indicates its relevance in explaining the role of the extensive margin (TPE growth) for US aggregate fluctuations.",

First, the evolution of net business formation has become more volatile, sensitive to the cycle, and persistent. Second, both fluctuations in the entry rate and, especially, the exit rate contribute substantially to business formation fluctuations during the Great Recession. Therefore, the processes of business creation and destruction in the US have brought significant variations in the extensive margin of economic activity that may have effects on aggregate fluctuations. These aspects of the extensive margin have not yet been investigated. Towards this end, we present in the next section a DSGE model with richer entry and exit dynamics relative to the literature.",

All the other observable series are comparable to those used in the estimation of the DSGE model by Smets and Wouters (2007) with three differences. First, the CPI has been used to deflate the nominal series to be consistent with the model. Secondly, per-capita series were computed dividing the aggregate series by the US working-age population adjusted by populational controls as released in the Current Population Survey of the Bureau of Labour Statistics (2013) . 24 And third, we have used the series of shadow nominal interest rate calculated by Wu and Xia, 2016 in order to accommodate the effects of the unconventional balance-sheet policy actions in the zero lower bound scenario of the Great Recession. 25 The constant exit rate model is also estimated excluding the series of establishment exit as observables because there is no liquidation value shock in the model. The sample period is constrained by data availability on US quarterly entry and exit, which runs from 1993:2 to 2018:4. Thus, we have 103 observations. Some standard underlying parameters are fixed before the estimation. Following Smets and Wouters, 2007 , the rate of capital depreciation is set at \u03b4 = 0 . 025 , the labor elasticity of substitution at \u03b8 w = 3 . 0 , and the government spending, \u03b5 g , is assumed to be 18% of aggregate output in steady-state, \u03b5 g = 0 . 18 y . In addition, the capital utilization rate is assumed to be equal to 100% in steady state ( u = 1 ), when there are no costs of variable capital utilization ( a (u ) = 0 ). The minimum firm-level productivity is normalized at z min = 1 . 0 . Finally, the parameter \u03c4 , which determines the share of sunk costs at entry (licence fee), is calibrated to imply that the total number of goods in steady state is normalized at n = 1 . This leads to choosing the value \u03c4 = 0 . 54 . Tables 2 and 3 display the priors and estimated posteriors found in the Bayesian estimation. The selection of priors mostly follows Lewis and Stevens (2015) and Smets and Wouters (2007) , and we only note here the few differences with these papers. The steady-state quarterly rate of exit is set at a prior of x = 2 . 91% (slightly higher than the value assigned by Lewis and Stevens, 2015 ) in order to match the mean value obtained in US data. Regarding the variable costs of business creation and destruction, we assume a quadratic specification in both cases with \u03c2 e = 2 and \u03c2 x = 2 . The size of these costs is controlled by their respective scale coefficents, e and x . Due to the uncertainty about these scale parameters, we have estimated the steady-state ratio of these entry and exit cost with respect to equity value. The priors are at 2%, ie., 21 Budget constraints for both the households and the government are taken into account for the derivation of the overall resources constraint (see the technical Appendix for the proof). 22 The non-linear system of equations that determines the balanced-growth solution in steady state is also available in the technical appendix. 23 The choice of ARMA(1,1) processes for these two shocks follows Smets and Wouters (2007) . It is a useful one as it allows us to capture the stickiness and persistency of prices and wages through the moving average component without the need of estimating a high number of parameter as in the case of an AR(n) process. 24 Hence, the observed time series obtained for the estimation are the establishment entry rate, the establishment exit rate, the log difference in percapita real GDP, the log difference in per-capita real Personal Consumption Expenditures, the log difference in per-capita real Private Fixed Investment, the log difference in the real wage obtained from the Average Hourly Earnings in the Nonfarm Business Sector, the rate of change in the GDP price deflator, the Wu and Xia (2016) 's shadow Federal Funds rate, and the log of Hours of per worker obtained as the product between the Average Weekly Hours and Civilian Employment divided by the Civilian Labor Force. The sources to obtain these series are the Business Employment Report from the BLS and the FRED database compiled by the St. Louis Fed. The measurement equations and data definitions are available in the technical appendix. 25 A recent paper by Ikeda et al. (2020) outlines several issues related to the estimation of models at the zero lower bound and formulates a shadow rate for monetary policy. ",

            "text": "We discuss here the dynamics of the number of firms and its influence on aggregate fluctuations in response to typical examples of either a supply-side shock or a demand-side shock. For the supply-side shock we show the effects of a total factor productivity (technology) innovation in Figure 2 . For a demand-side shock, Fig. 3 displays the responses following a exogenous increase in the risk-premium. The size of the shocks have been normalized at the values of their corresponding estimated standard deviations reported in Table 3 . We have decided to show the impulse-response functions after technology and risk-premium shocks because they take the highest shares in the variance decomposition of the rate of growth of the total number of firms (see the column labeled n in Table 5 ), which make them the main sources for fluctuations of the extensive margin in the US. 30 Fig. 2 . Impulse-response functions following a technology shock. As Fig. 2 shows, a technology shock increases the entry rate and reduces the exit rate, which results in a positive variation in the total number of firms. 31 Although the intensive margin (average firm-level production) takes the initial stand to bring aggregate output growth, the gradual response of the extensive margin (number of firms) turns dominant a few quarters after the shock. Thus, the extensive margin amplifies the effect of a technology shock because of the procyclical reaction of net business formation. The average production of incumbents falls below its steady-state threshold value several quarters after the shock, which leaves an industry with more firms producing lower amounts of output. The positive effect on entry occurs because households invest on business creation as they observe an increase of equity value due to higher expected dividends and lower interest rates. The effective entry takes one period to be materialized on the goods market due to the time-to-build requirement. Meanwhile, the exit rate decreases. The positive technology shock lowers the critical productivity z cr because of a decrease in the expected real marginal cost, combined with a higher expected aggregate output and a higher expected unit revenue at the firms (see the dynamic equation for z cr , (14)). In Hamano and Zanetti (2017) 's flexible-price model with endogenous exit, this average firm-level productivity rises after an adverse technology shock. This result can be replicated in our model by reversing the sign of the shock displayed in Fig. 2 . 32 In the model with constant exit rate, the role of the extensive margin is weaker because the adjustement to the shock does not take into account the decrease in the rate of firms' exit for an almost similar increase in the rate of entry. Subsequently, establishments grow more slowly and the technology shock has a higher positive impact on firm-level production. Fig. 3 plots the responses obtained following a risk-premium shock. The effective real interest rate rises and aggregate demand shrinks as households reduce their desired spending on both consumption and investment goods. Such demand contraction results in a long-lasting decline of aggregate output, fed by the two margins as both the number of firms and the amount of firm-level output produced fall. The net business destruction is mostly explained by a procyclical reaction of entry because firm exit rises at the time of the shock but soon moves down to the negative side. 33 The persistent fall of business entry comes justified by the lower average equity value due to the combination of higher interest rates and lower expected dividends. Over the first quarters after the shock, the intensive margin absorbs the demand contraction and firms reduce their production with no significant business destruction. However, as time goes by, the number of establishments keeps falling because the effective firm entry needs more than 40 quarters to return to its steady state level. Thus, the model with entry and exit reports a longer recession after a risk-premium shock in comparison to a DSGE model with a constant exit rate in which the entry rate returns quicker to steady state and the exit rate does not change.",

            "text": "The empirical evidence provided in Section 2 indicates that the short-run fluctuations of the quarterly rates of TPE growth in the US have turned more volatile, more persistent and more correlated with real GDP growth after the financial crisis. Using counterfactual simulations within our baseline estimated model, we can discuss the sources of aggregate fluctuations during the Great Recession. 34 The size and sign of the shocks may be a key factor to explain the new patterns of US business cycle fluctuations. 35 There could also have been structural breaks on key parameters that govern price/wage rigidities, monetary policy, production technology or household preferences. 36 Unfortunately, data availabilty leaves short the number of observations of the subsamples of the Great Moderation and Great Recession (55 and 48 observations, respectively) and the quality of the estimation results would be questioned. In spite of that, we have run the subsamples estimation and reported the results in the technical Appendix. 37 Fig. 4 displays the quarterly contributions of a selection of shocks to the fluctuations of the rate of growth of US Total Private Establishments per capita, the rate of growth of the US real GDP per capita, the US establishment entry rate and the US establishment exit rate from 2007:1 to 2018:4. The criterion to decide the shocks to display has been to select those with the largest contribution to the variability of the corresponding endogenous variable. Table 6 provides the standard deviations of the contributions of the nine shocks. The four highest values from each variable determine the list of shocks on display in Fig. 4 . 38 As observed in Fig. 4 , technology shocks are crucial for the recovery of business activity (TPE) from 2009 to 2012 (as it can be foreseen when looking at the estimated series of the shock available in the technical Appendix). Actually, the contributions of technological innovations for TPE growth, real GDP growth and the entry rate swing dramatically from negative values at the early stages of the financial crisis to positive values in 2009. In addition, technology shocks have a major role on the reduction of the exit rate after 2009. Quarterly contributions of positive technology shocks range between 0.5% and 1% for both TPE growth and real GDP growth, and numbers remain on the positive side until 2012. It could be argued that the enormous business destruction that took place during the financial crisis of 2008 (more than 10 0,0 0 0 establishments closed in net terms) led to economy-wide technological innovations a few quarters later. This can be considered as a Schumpeterian interpretation (creative destruction) following the exit of the least productive firms, supported by the estimation results showing technology shocks help the business formation along the recovery path. 39 34 The analysis of this section is restricted to the baseline model with endogenous entry and exit as it has proved a better capacity to explain the US quarterly data on business creation and destruction. 35 As we document in the technical Appendix, the estimated series of the shocks of the model have some specific patterns during the Great Recession. In particular, technology shocks are more volatile and persistent, risk-premium shocks are more persistent, and fiscal shocks are less volatile and persistent. Remarkably, the quarterly series of risk-premium shock swings from the negative to the positive side in 2007, with high values (bordering the 1% value per quarter, 4% annualized) from 2008 to 2013. Technology shocks also play a significant role during the Great Recession as they turn strongly positive on the quarters that initiate the recovery path (2009) (2010) (2011) . 36 Hurtado (2014) estimates Smets and Wouters, 2007 model using a rolling-window approach. He shows that most parameters, including those that are considered structural, exhibit major shifts. This applies specifically to those related to Calvo price stickiness and the elasticity of labor supply. 37 In summary, we find that the Great Moderation had lower estimated values for the elasticity of the capital adjustment costs, \u03d5 k , and the capital share in the production technology, which explain the higher responsiveness of investment and physical capital (intensive margin) to absorb the effects of shocks. 38 See the technical Appendix for the complete shock decomposition with all the shocks of the model, and also for a display of the full sample period, 1993 to 2018. 39 There is empirical evidence consistent with our results: technology shocks grow after the financial crisis while the number of establishments fall. Following the Solow residual methodology of Fernald, 2014 , the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco publishes a times series of Total Factor Productivity (TFP) growth in the US. This reports high rates of growth of US productivity in 2009 and 2010, with annualized rates of growth of TFP close to 4%. Moreover, The other main driver of recent US business fluctuations is risk premium shocks. Fig. 4 identifies risk-premium innovations as responsible for the severe contractions of both the number of establishments and real GDP in 2008 and 2009. Such negative contributions of risk-premium shocks averaging around 0.5% for TPE growth and 1% for real GDP growth between 2008 and 2009, consistent with the rapid increase in the cost of borrowing for the private sector (the deepest impact is a -2.27% cut in real GDP estimated for the last quarter of 2008). 40 It can also observed in Fig. 4 that the reduction in the number of establishments due to risk-premium shocks is simultaneously explained by a negative effect on the entry rate and the positive impact on the exit rate. The contributions of risk premium shock are very persistent: still contractionary until 2011 for real GDP growth (though its size and effect are diminishing over time) and even longer lasting for entry and exit which suffer negative contributions until 2014.",

Other adverse fiscal shocks on GDP are displayed in Fig. 4 corresponding to the fiscal cliff turbulences occurred in 2012-2014.",

The model simulations provide a good matching to the second-moment statistics of the rate of growth of US private businesses, and also for those of the entry and exit rates.

Moreover, shocks on the entry cost and liquidation value shocks explain together 13% of fluctuations of US real GDP growth and 27% of variability on the rate of growth of US private establishments. The evolution of the entry rate depends upon both demand and supply factors with a prevalence of risk-premium and monetary policy shocks, whereas the exit rate is mainly affected by supply factors such as shocks on technology and on firm liquidation value.",
