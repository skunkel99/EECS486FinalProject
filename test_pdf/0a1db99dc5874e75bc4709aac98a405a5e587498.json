Care homes, including those with and without registered nurses (RNs), increasingly look after older people with complex multiple morbidities. 4 Projections show that if current trends continue, care homes will be the most common place of death by 2040. 5 Residents often experience inadequate end-of-life care as a result of avoidable hospitalisations, 6 unmanaged symptoms, poor anticipatory/advance care planning 7 and communication barriers. 8 9 Staff report difficulties with interdisciplinary working, 10 and low confidence and capability 7 in managing symptoms and identifying when people are dying, deficiencies exacerbated by workforce issues, including staff shortages, high turnover 11 12 and time restrictions. 13 Residents often have multiple admissions to hospital prior to their death, 6 with some admissions potentially preventable. 14 Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba Using implementation science will improve the chances of Needs Rounds being successfully implemented across the sites. \u25ba Data collection techniques will flexibly use video interviews and virtual workshops to accommodate lockdown and social distancing measures. \u25ba Care home staff collection of resident data will prevent the need for research staff to access personal data or enter care homes when there are concerns about COVID-19 transmission.",

A systematic review of end-of-life care in UK care homes calls for the extension of specialist palliative care in care homes. 10 Key issues reported include staff struggling to identify when residents are approaching end of life and unanticipated deterioration impacting decision-making about hospitalisations. Anticipatory/advance care planning training needs were also highlighted, with staff frequently avoiding these conversations due to lacking confidence and knowledge. The need to strengthen interdisciplinary working to address reactive decision-making and improve understanding about who is responsible for discussions about end-of-life care was also described.",

Current approaches such as ECHO (Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes), 16 Gold Standard Framework (GSF), 17 Macmillan's education for carers 'Foundations in Palliative Care', Six Steps to Success, 18 PACE (Palliative Care Across Europe) 19 and the Namaste programme 20 offer staff training, yet rarely facilitate evidence-based clinical input for people diagnosed as dying. Both the GSF 21 and PACE 22 recommend monthly interdisciplinary meetings, although this is often variable in practice. Furthermore, such interventions often fail to change behaviour. 23 24 This study aims to address recognised deficits in the provision of palliative and end-of-life care in care homes, by using an implementation science approach to alter practice and embed a promising approach developed in Australia called 'Palliative Care Needs Rounds' (Needs Rounds). Needs Rounds improve palliative and end-of-life care by reducing unnecessary hospitalisations, increasing staff knowledge and capability, improving anticipatory/ advance care planning and strengthening interagency working.",

Each case comprises a specialist palliative care team working with 4-6 care homes each. i-PARIHS represents an integrated approach, recognising that most implementation is complex, requiring attention to multiple factors simultaneously for an innovation to be successful. The development of theory is central to i-PAHRIS and enables effective implementation of research evidence into everyday practice. 33 Programme theories explaining micro changes and transactions, such as working hypotheses or local theories of change, are explored to elucidate core concepts. From these, mid-range theories are developed that have greater explanatory potential to predict and plan for change across different settings. 33 For this study, theories will be generated regarding (1) influential components of the UK context and (2) the mechanisms of how to implement Needs Rounds in care homes in order to deliver desired outcomes.",

These variables reflect the dominant contextual influences which are likely to impact how Needs Rounds are used in the UK. Table 1 provides a breakdown of the inclusion criteria for each participant group. The qualitative sample (n=40 interviewees) seeks adequate depth and breadth to determine the implementation objective: 'what works for whom under what circumstances'. Interview sample sizes are based on the Australian studies, and are congruent with accepted standards for qualitative data interpretation. 36 For the quantitative sample, the average size of the care homes is anticipated to be 52 beds, and the rate of emergency admission to hospital to be 0.173 per bed within the 4-month period, 37 with an average of 9 admissions per care home. A sample of 30 care homes would allow change to be identified in the hospitalisation rate of 0.02 per bed (\u03b1=0.05, \u03b2=0.2, \u0394SD=0.040). This is sufficient to detect a clinically meaningful change in the primary outcome (reduction of one hospitalisation per 4 month period in a typical care home) for the quantifiable data in phase 2. context. Data will be collected through 40 semistructured individual or small-group interviews with key stakeholders from the six case study sites. Interviewees will be asked to describe their local context, such as services' geography, policy, structure, funding and practice elements. Contextual factors can significantly impact implementation; therefore, understanding and being responsive to these components are essential. 34 Key contextual factors will be mapped out in the phase 1 interviews, drawing on the i-PAHRIS inner (micro and meso) and outer level (macro) contextual factors. 38 The former includes individual and organisational components such as culture, leadership, experience of innovation, and absorptive capacity, while the latter examines the wider health system, including policy drivers, regulatory frameworks, and interorganisational networks and relationships. Services' geography, policy, structure, funding and practice elements will then be refined in workshops to codesign Needs Rounds. Differences between the UK and Australia will be described.",

Reporting a cost effectiveness range will allow the uncertainty in the treatment estimate in the cost effectiveness figures to be captured.

PPI members will attend monthly investigator meetings and provide advice on all aspects of the study. They will assist with refining recruitment processes (including recruiting family members to phase 1), participate in the workshops to coproduce Needs Rounds, data collection, and data analysis. The PPI members will also disseminate information about the study and its results through talks to local carers groups and social media (blogs and Twitter).
