Methods and results In a single-centre cross-sectional observational study, we included 355 patients with AMI containing ST-elevation or non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI), admitted for emergency cardiac catheterization between January and April 2020 and the equivalent time in 2019. During the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic (e-COV) in Berlin (March and April 2020), admissions for AMI halved compared with those in the pre-Covid-19 time (January and February 2020; pre-COV) and with those in the corresponding months in 2019. However, mortality for AMI increased substantially from 5.2% pre-COV to 17.7% (P < 0.05) during e-COV. Severity of presentation for AMI was more pronounced during e-COV [increased levels of cardiac enzymes, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), an increase in the need of inotropic support by 25% (P < 0.01)], while patients' demographic and angiographic characteristics did not differ between pre-COV and e-COV. Time from symptom onset to first medical contact was prolonged in all AMI during e-COV (presentation > 72 h +21% in STEMI, p = 0.04 and presentation > 72 h in NSTEMI +22%, p = 0.02). Door to balloon time was similar in STEMI patients, while time from first medical contact to revascularization was significantly delayed in NSTEMI patients (p = 0.02). Major cardiac complications after AMI occurred significantly more often, and cardiac recovery was worse in e-COV than in pre-COV, demonstrated by a significantly lower LVEF (39 \u00b1 16 vs. 46 \u00b1 16, p < 0.05) at hospital discharge and substantially higher NTproBNP levels.",

For comparison, data were also obtained for January to April 2019. Our centre is a tertiary-care cardiovascular centre with cardiovascular surgery on site, offering 24/7 coronary intervention availability according to current guidelines. 12 A total of 355 patients were included (208 on January-April 2019; 96 on January-February 2020; and 51 on March and April 2020). The Covid-19 pandemic has reached Germany on 27 January. In consequence, federal and state authorities implemented a stepwise strategy to reduce mobility and motivate the community to social distancing in order to control the outbreak and prevent exhaustion of the health care system. The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) provided the country with daily actual information about the new SARS-CoV-2 referring to the official WHO numbers. 4 In cooperation with Humboldt University of Berlin, the RKI analysed anonymized mobility flows in Germany, which were gathered from mobile phone data. 19 It could be demonstrated that mobility dramatically dropped in Germany starting from the beginning of March with a peak between mid of March to mid of April (time of the so-called lockdown in Germany 19 ). Besides largely reduced mobility due to the countrywide lockdown and reduced availability of general practitioner and cardiology outpatient services, patients were concerned of SARS-CoV-2 infection by getting in contact with the health care system. In consequence, reduced availability of non-emergent medical care, as well as individual concerns on the risks of health care contacts, may have impact on the clinical course of CAD from stable to unstable. The main aim of the study was to demonstrate the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on hospitalization and in-hospital death for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). A time delay in admissions for AMI (time from symptom onset to first medical contact) with consecutive prolonged ischaemic time should be evaluated with biomarkers for myocardial injury [high-sensitivity troponin (troponin hs) and creatine kinase (CK)]. Additionally, the persistent myocardial damage -represented as the maximum of CK and its myocardial isoform (CK-MB)-should be investigated during Covid-19 in all AMIs. Furthermore, we investigate the time from symptom onset to first medical contact in all AMI patients as well as the door to balloon time in STEMI patients and the time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on major cardiac complications, as a composite endpoint of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock-defined by systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg for at least 30 min with evidence of poor tissue perfusion after correction of non-myocardial factors and life-threating arrhythmias [sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VFib)]-should be investigated in all AMIs. Finally, to evaluate cardiac outcome, we measured the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, %) with echocardiography as an important parameter for cardiac function and additionally determined a specific biomarker for heart failure incidence [N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP)] in all AMI patients during the Covid-19 pandemic. The collection of clinical and laboratory data was performed using an electronic data storage software and was cross-checked by the investigators.",

While door to balloon time in STEMI patients was not significantly changed, the time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients during the early-Covid-19 pandemic was significantly delayed. Consequently, time delay in admission with AMI was associated with a prolonged ischaemic time, leading to a more pronounced myocardial injury and damage at first medical contact represented as relevantly increased cardiac enzymes, reduced LVEF, and higher use of inotropic support. Moreover, major cardiac complications including cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening arrhythmias occurred substantially more often during the early-Covid-19 pandemic.

            "text": "In fact, admissions for AMI were halved in the 2 months after the Covid-19 outbreak starting on 1 March in Berlin compared with January and February 2020 where no Covid-19 infection was recognized. However, case fatality rate of AMI significantly increased about 12.5% during the same time in the Covid-19 pandemic. A relation of the first 4 months (January to April) in 2020 to 2019 showed that hospitalization for AMI was not different in January and February of both years, while on March and April 2020, the admissions for AMI decreased nearly 50% in comparison with those in 2019. In the equivalent period, the mortality of AMI increased substantially about 10% in 2020 compared with 2019, while in the first 2 months, mortality was unchanged between the years. These findings are in line with other studies from Hong Kong, 15, 16 Italy, 20 Spain, 21 and the USA, 8, 18 where a decrease in AMI was reported. The potential mechanism leading to the reduction in admissions for MI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic is multifactorial. The recommendation of social distancing and avoiding congregation of people led to a substantial decrease in mobility on March and April 2020 compared with January and February 2020 as well as with the equivalent period in 2019. The RKI and the Humboldt University of Berlin analysed anonymized mobility flows in Germany, which are gathered from mobile phone data ('Covid-19-mobility project' 19 ). There was an initial drop in mobility up to \u00c039% in mid-March 2020 until mid-April 2020 compared with the year 2019, recognized as representing the time of 'lockdown in Germany'. 19 The majority of hospitals and other health care services have postponed elective surgeries and cardiac procedures, including coronary angiography during the Covid-19 pandemic, to be prepared and have enough medical resources including intensive care units, personal protective equipment, and medical stuff. 8 Emergency response measurements, which are necessary and important for infection control, were implemented in the regular hospital operation procedures Figure 4 Major cardiac complications after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during Covid-19 pandemic: major cardiac complications after AMI represented as a composite endpoint of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock, and life-threatening arrhythmias (including ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation) were significantly higher in early-Covid-19 (black bars: e-COV = 1 March to 30 April) pandemic compared with the pre-Covid-19 time (white bars: pre-COV = 1 January to 29 February). Data are percentage. Statistical analysis was performed with \u03c7 2 tests. Statistical significance was reached with a P < 0.05. including regular temperature measurements, more common testing of suspected SARS-CoV-2 cases, and the early isolation of suspected infected patients. 15, 16, 20 Many patients with severe medical problems, including chest pain, tried to endure their symptoms until intolerance and did not seek out a hospital, because they are in fear of an infection with SARS-CoV-2 in the clinics. All these factors together potentially increased time to first medical contact and caused a further delay in adequate medical therapy. Regarding the treatment of AMI with PCI as recommended by the guidelines, this could lead to a prolonged ischaemic time and therefore an increased mortality and worse cardiac outcome. [11] [12] [13] [14] 22 We could not observe any differences in our patients during the Covid-19 pandemic regarding age, sex, or medical history including arterial hypertension, dyslipidaemia, known CADs with prior MI, PCI or CAGB, diabetes, obesity, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the total number of AMI substantially decreased during the early-Covid-19 pandemic in Berlin (\u00c047%), we recognized a small relative increase in STEMI (+15%) patients in our study. Studies from US CCLs 8 estimated 38% reduction in MI activations, while in Spain, 21 a 40% reduction was noticed. A multicentre analysis from Northern California even showed a decrease of 48% in AMI (including STEMI and NSTEMI patients) during the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in the USA. 18 Furthermore, there was a small increase in patients admitted to our CCL after cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (+7), with cardiogenic shock (+9%) or with initial life-threatening arrhythmias including VT or Vfib (+6%). Coronary angiography evaluation of the culprit vessel could not show any differences between the pre-COV and e-COV periods. Additionally, initial successful revisualization of the culprit vessel was similar in all patients. There are previous studies that investigated the time delay between symptom onset and hospital admissions for STEMI patients 8 as well as the substantially increased time from first medical contact to coronary revascularization. 15, 20 In our study, we could demonstrate a relevant time delay from symptom onset to first medical contact for STEMI and NSTEMI patients. However, door to balloon time was unchanged in STEMI during e-COV. Time from first medical contact to revascularization in NSTEMI patients on the other hand was significantly prolonged during e-COV. These delays consecutively lead to a prolongation of the total ischaemic time after MI. As a potential result of the prolonged ischaemic time, patients with AMI during e-COV presented with a substantially more pronounced phenotype to the hospitals. The severity of the presentation was reflected by a significant increase in initial measured troponin and CK at first medical contact. Furthermore, in 45% of the patients in e-COV, the measured LVEF was mild to severely reduced compared with 20% in the pre-COV period. Additionally, patients who presented with AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic needed substantially more inotropic support compared with the pre-COV time. Furthermore, we could report that the total damage of myocardium after AMI was higher during the early-Covid-19 pandemic, which was represented as significantly higher amount of maximum values for CK and CK-MB. Besides these findings, we evaluated cardiac function with echocardiographic measured LVEF during hospitalization. We could demonstrate a significantly lower LVEF as marker for a more impaired cardiac function after AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic. Moreover, we recognized a significant increase of the biomarker NTproBNP in AMI during the early-Covid-19 pandemic, which led us to the conclusion that patients with AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic have a worse cardiac outcome and a higher incidence of heart failure. In accordance with previous reports, 15, 16, 20 we observed a significantly higher rate of major cardiac complications including CPR, CS, and VT in AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic.",

Time delay in admission and medical treatment for AMI resulted in the prolongation in myocardial ischaemic time. We could demonstrate that a prolonged myocardial ischaemic time was reflected by a significant increase in cardiac enzymes like troponin hs and CK at first medical contact after AMI during Covid-19 outbreak. Furthermore, we recognized a substantially higher use of inotropic support after AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic as an expression of worse cardiac function. Moreover, we were able to show that patients who suffered from an AMI during the Covid-19 pandemic had a more pronounced myocardial damage represented as higher CK max and CK-MB max values. Finally, patients had worse cardiac short-term outcome represented as lower LVEF and higher incidence of heart failure represented as increased NTproBNP levels in the early phase of COVID-19 pandemic.",

This leads to a higher mortality, more severe cardiac complications, and a worse cardiac short-term outcome of AMI patients during the Covid-19 outbreak in a tertiary-care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. Our data indicate that Covid-19 impacts on non-infectious disease states, such as acute coronary syndromes. Therefore, it is important that health care professionals including cardiologists, do not forget their actual patient population and treat them in compliance with recent guidelines besides the fight against the SARS-CoV-2 infection all over the world.",

            "text": "Clinical data collection during a pandemic emergency is challenging, and resources are restricted. Most of in-hospital processes underwent reorganization with the focus on patient care and infection protection. Nevertheless, we collected data to investigate the impact of the early-Covid-19 pandemia on the admission and mortality rate of AMI in a tertiary-care university hospital in Berlin, Germany. To avoid losing important and relevant patient information, we cross-checked reports from our CCL with the emergency room and intensive care unit Myocardial infarction during Covid-19 pandemic reports. Extensive data collection during the initial phase of a pandemia was not possible. Therefore, we had to focus on the most important and available facts that we can obtain from our patient population and have to leave out nonessential but potentially interesting variables like clinical risk scores in all STEMI and NSTEMI patients. For the same reason, the study period was limited to the early phase of the Covid-19 outbreak in Berlin. The short time period of 2 months for data collection represents a source for potential bias. Finally, as this study was a single-centre observational study, we just described a phenomenon, and no demonstration of a clear cause can be drawn. Table S1 . Hospitalization and case fatality rate for acute myocardial infarction during Covid-19 pandemic Reduced number of admissions for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during early-Covid-19 (e-COV = March 1st to April 30th) pandemic compared to the pre-Covid-19 time (pre-COV = January 1st to February 29th). Increased mortality rate in Covid-19 outbreak compared to pre-Covid-19 time: Absolute number of admissions for AMI during e-COV (N = 51) and pre-COV (N = 96). Data are absolute values or percentage. Statistical significance was reached with a P < 0.05. Table S2 . Admission for acute myocardial infarction and mortality between January and April 2020 compared to the previous year 2019: There were no differences in hospitalizations for AMI in January and February 2020 and 2019, while in March and April 2020 admissions for AMI halved compared to 2019. Absolute number of admissions. Mortality was unchanged in January and February 2020 and 2019, however in March mortality rate increased by 10.5% and in April by 11.8% in 2020 (Covid-19 outbreak) compared to 2019. Case fatality rate among patients admitted for AMI in percentage. Table S3 . Marker for cardiac injury, damage and cardiac outcome: High sensitive troponin (Troponin hs, ng/L) and creatine kinase (CK, U/L) at first medical contact during Covid-19 pandemic as marker for myocardial injury. Myocardial subunit of creatine kinase (CK-MB, U/L) and maximum measured creatine kinase (CKmax, U/L) as marker for total myocardial damage after AMI during Covid-19 outbreak. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF,%). NTproBNP (ng/L) as biomarker for heart failure. Data are mean\u00b1SD. Statistical significance was reached with a P < 0.05.",
