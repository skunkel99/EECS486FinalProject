The transition to a health care system based on electronic information will require changes in expectations and create varying degrees of confusion as new patterns of practice are developed. The availability of substantially complete information about patients at most clinical encounters will be a dramatic change from current practice, for example, and is likely to require significant adaptations in the methods that physicians use to review and evaluate patients. Clear understanding of NHII including its benefits and progress will be essential to address the anxieties that will naturally arise from this change process. Concerns about privacy are particularly sensitive. Since clinical practice will change, training programs for health professionals must also incorporate modern information systems to prepare trainees for practicing with NHII. There will also be substantial demands for health informatics professionals to lead and coordinate NHII development activities, so steps must be taken to strengthen and expand specialized training programs to assure an adequate supply. The critical need to increase our public health preparedness makes these educational issues even more urgent.",

These recommendations fell into two major categories: funding for the initial investment in health IT to create NHII, and financial incentives to ensure its sustainability. The group concluded that the current reimbursement system does not provide sufficient incentives for acquisition and use of health IT and suggested multiple approaches to address this problem. Participants recognized that modernizing reimbursement policy would be key to sustainability of health IT, especially since substantial savings from improved efficiency are expected from the application of this technology. Since payment incentives for quality care depend on measurements most easily derived from EHR systems, quality incentives alone may be problematic prior to EHR system availability to provide those measures.

Attendees placed high priority on increasing the use of designated standards\u2014not only to enhance data exchange and aggregation, but also to generate the broad feedback needed to improve the standards. There were recommendations to promote early adoption of standards by federal agencies and to provide standard identifiers and codes as close as possible to the source of data, e.g., devices or test kits. Participants also agreed on the need to continue the existing standards designation processes, i.e., the Consolidated Health Informatics (CHI) Initiative23 and implementation of the patient medical record information recommendations of the NCVHS24; to provide adequate ongoing funding for standards development; to bolster standards maintenance processes to respond to feedback from increasing use; and to ensure that designated vocabulary and messaging standards work together as a coherent set.",

The primary reason for this local/regional approach is that medical care itself is primarily a local service, with the exception of cross-country consultations. The community approach provides a manageable implementation project with participants who have the shared motivation of improving health care in their own geographic area. The sometimes difficult compromises required for agreements to facilitate sharing of health information (e.g., between competitors) are also more easily made at a community level, where all involved have a common and easily perceived interest in improving health care for themselves and their neighbors. The attendees suggested that regional steering committees would be the best organizational entities to build these community health information infrastructures. An incremental approach to data exchange and interoperability was recommended to minimize disruption from overly rapid change. Linkages among these regional steering committees should be established to promote sharing of lessons learned so that best practices can be developed and disseminated.",

All NHII activities require the ability to identify information that relates to specific individuals, particularly when linking data from multiple sources into a single record for delivery at the point of care. The congressional prohibition against creation of a national unique health care identifier reflects the substantial concern in the general population that use of such an identifier would increase the risk of privacy violations. The recommended approaches to solving this problem varied among the breakout groups. The architecture group recommended that NHII development proceed without a unique national health identifier for individuals, but that mechanisms used for effective patient identification be reviewed. The consumer health group asked for resolution of the patient identification issue, without being specific about how the problem should be solved. The research group asked for the establishment of patient linkage variables and methodology for research purposes, but noted that less than 100% accuracy would be adequate for most clinical research. Finally, the safety and quality group specifically recommended a new unique national patient identifier and asked for the implementation of a national unique identifier for providers (as already being implemented as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA]) to ensure proper authentication of health care professionals requesting patient information.",

It was recommended that PHRs be available at no charge to consumers from a trusted authority. Efforts should be made to promote the development of e-health tools, for example, to link the PHR to relevant electronic health information resources (e.g., MEDLINE). The PHR should support both health alerts (e.g., warnings and notifications of newly available relevant information) and decision support (e.g., information resources to assist consumers in evaluating their treatment options) for consumers, with linkages to their health care professionals.

However, the recommendations from the attendees in two of the breakout groups primarily focused on research about methods, approaches, and results of activities related specifically to the NHII itself, e.g., measuring the costs and benefits of EHRs. The attendees recommended that $1 billion of funding per year be allocated for research relating health IT to quality of care and patient safety. Such research would include evaluation of the impact of information systems on safety and quality; improved methods of adverse event detection using electronic medical records; evaluation of existing published studies of privacy in relation to NHII; assessment of individual perceptions and perspectives on the privacy of health information; and development of methods for communicating medical knowledge within the NHII to ensure its timely and effective use in patient care.

The recommended approach to NHII through the development of community health information exchanges provides physicians with substantial opportunities to participate locally in the transition to a health care system enhanced with modern IT.

For example, the focus of current federal funding for NHII demonstration projects uses the local and regional approach recommended by attendees. Subsequent national meetings will serve to further refine and modify these consensus views, as well as develop specific implementation strategies. Continuing collaborative efforts toward NHII should maximize the ability to achieve a safer, more effective, and more efficient health care system rapidly through the widespread adoption of health IT.",
